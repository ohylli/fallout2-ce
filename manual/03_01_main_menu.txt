Main Menu
When you start Fallout 2, after watching the introductory
movie, you will see the Main Menu. This is probably the
single most important screen in the entire game, since
without it you can’t actually start playing.
Select from the following:
INTRO - Replay the intro movie. Use this to amaze your
friends.
NEW GAME - Start a new game. Create a character, or
select a pre-generated character, and start playing
Fallout 2 from the very beginning. If you have just
installed Fallout 2, or you have never saved a game, you
will need to press this button. See page 16 for more
information on starting a new game.
LOAD GAME - Once you have started a game and saved it in
order to return to it at a later date without having to
start a completely new game, this is the button for you.
Pressing this button will take you to the Load Game
screen (see page 78), where you can select from any of
your previously saved games.
CREDITS - Press this button to see a list of the fine
people who have brought you Fallout 2. Your enjoyment is
all they have thought about!
EXIT - Pressing this button will return you to your
normal operating system. You will not be asked to confirm
the exit when you press this button. Zap! One second you
are playing Fallout 2, the next second you are back to
work. Life just isn’t fair.
Also displayed on the Main Menu screen is the current
version number of the game.
