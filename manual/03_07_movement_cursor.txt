MOVEMENT CURSOR
============================================================

Movement Cursor
The default cursor is the movement cursor. It looks like
a hex. Hex is short for hexagon, a six-sided polygon.
Characters in Fallout 2 can be facing one of six
directions. The movement cursor will control where your
character can move to in the game view. Move this cursor
around the screen. If you cannot move to the location
under the hex, a red X will appear in the centre of the
cursor. There are two ways to move: walking and running.
One of the preferences, Running, will change the default
move type. See page 79 for more details about the
preferences.
Walking
If you left-click when the movement cursor is displayed,
your character will attempt to walk to that location,
using the shortest path available. The shortest path to
some destinations is not always the best one. If the
shortest path looks dangerous to you, use small steps and
walk carefully around that ticking box lying in the
centre of the corridor with the large red BOMB letters on
it. The setting of the Running preference may change the
default action of the left-click.

Running
If you press SHIFT and left-click when the movement
cursor is displayed, your character will run to the
desired location using the shortest path available. This
assumes that the Running preference is set to the default
of Normal. If the preference is instead set to Always, a
simple left-click will make your character run, and you
must hold SHIFT and left-click to make your character
walk.
You can always interrupt your character while he or
she is moving with another movement command.
Things that affect movement
If your character has a crippled leg or two, see Damage
(page 131), your character cannot run. Movement during
turn-based combat is limited and requires the spending of
action points. Moving one hex requires one action point.
