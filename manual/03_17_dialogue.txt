DIALOGUE
============================================================

Dialogue
Talking makes the world go around. So does sex. And while
you may not be able to go to bed with every person in
the game, at least you can talk to them. Most of the
time, they will even talk back. Talking to people is an
important part of your job, as an explorer, since it is
one of the primary ways of getting information and
quests.
To talk to a person, use the command cursor and the
Talk action icon. The Talk icon is the default action, so
most of the time you only have to click on a person to
start talking to them. If you are in the middle of
combat, and trying to blow them away, don’t expect them
to start a little chat about the weather at that point.
Some NPCs will also start a conversation with you, when
you get close enough to them. All dialogue works the same
once a conversation is started.
There are two types of dialogue: chatting and
extended.

Chatting Dialogue
If an NPC has very little to
say to you, and they don’t really
want to hear what you have to
say anyways, they will just chat
with you. A line of dialogue will
appear over their head in the
main game view. Most of the time,
this is something as simple as
“Hello!”, but sometimes those
sneaky game designers will put a
“Hey, you’d better not move, or I
will shoot you” type of line in
there. In other words, most of
the time,
don’t worry what that person has to
say to you. Sometimes, an important
clue or order could be given to you
via the chatting dialogue line.
NPCs will also chat during
combat. These are called combat
taunts. Few combat taunts are
pleasant. Fortunately, you can turn
them off via the Preferences screen
(see page 79.) Your character will
never use combat taunts. We fully
expect you to scream those out
loud, and frighten your neighbours.
If an NPC
doesn’t have a head,
that is not to say they
are not important.  And
if an NPC does have a
head, that doesn’t make
them critical to the
game.

Extended Dialogue
When NPCs have something to say,
and you can respond to their
comments or ask questions, you
will enter the extended dialogue
screen. From here, you will get a
view of the NPC, see what he or
she has to say, and get a chance
to respond to them. This screen
will also allow you to Barter or
Trade with the NPC, and review
the current conversation.
Some NPCs are special, and you
will see a close-up of their
head. Others are not so special,
and you will just see a shot of this character just
standing around in the game view.
If an NPC does have a head, watch their facial
expressions. They will give you a clue as to how the NPC
really feels about your character.
The NPCs dialogue will appear below their portrait or
picture. If the text of what they have to say to you is
too big to fit on the screen at once, only a small
portion will be displayed at a time. The rest of the text
will be displayed one screen at a time, until you see
their entire speech. You can use the mouse cursor to
review their speech, or advance it if you are a quick
reader.
Below the NPC’s speech, you will have one or more
lines that your character can say. Exactly which lines
that appear are based on your character. Your
characteristics are the major factor, primarily
Intelligence, but sometimes what skills you excel at.
What else your character has done, or talked to people
about, will also modify what options you have.
If you only see [DONE], you are at the end of a
conversation.
NPCs will react differently to different lines. If
your character says something stupid or inappropriate,
some NPCs will get upset and others will just get on with
their lives. Since having a higher Intelligence means
that you get to see more options, you can choose between
simple grunts and well-spoken diatribes against the
Characters
with a high Intelligence
will have more options
to select from when
talking to NPCs.
Something to think
about when you select
or create a character.
NOTES

capitalistic war-mongers. An Intelligence of three or
less means that your character can only grunt and will be
unable to converse like a sentient being. NPCs will have
a hard time understanding characters with super low IN.
Select a line of dialogue for your character to say by
moving the mouse cursor over an option, and when the line
highlights, click the left-button. The NPC will usually
respond to that line of dialogue, and then you will be
presented with more options. Continue making comments, or
asking questions, until the NPC runs out of things to say
or you really anger them and it starts combat.
Some of the lines are questionable, and can make the
NPC respond one way or another. These lines usually have
some sort of characteristic roll associated with them.
Usually Speech, but occasionally another skill or even a
statistic. The most common usage of Speech is to lie to
an NPC. The quality of your lie, and their ability (or
inability) to see through your lie, depends greatly on
your Speech skill.
You can review an extended dialogue, to see what you
or the NPC have said, by pressing the REVIEW button on
this screen. A simple window will appear with the
conversation printed verbatim.
If the conversation is
longer than can be printed on
one screen, use the arrow keys
to scroll the screen. Press the
DONE button to return to the
conversation. You can only
review the current conversation
with this NPC, and as soon as
you quit the dialogue, the
conversation will be lost. For
you programmers out there, it
gets sent to /dev/null.
The only way to completely exit a conversation,
however, is by getting to the end. Once you start talking
to an NPC, you must see it through. One of your options
will usually allow you to end the conversation at any time,
and once you or the NPC run out of things to say you
will see the [DONE] option, but until then you must
continue to talk it out.
