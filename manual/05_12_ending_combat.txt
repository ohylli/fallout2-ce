ENDING COMBAT
============================================================

Ending Combat
If there are no more hostile critters around, combat will
end automatically. You can also attempt to end combat
early by using the END COMBAT button on the interface
bar. If there are hostile critters nearby that want to
continue fighting, the END COMBAT button will not work
but you will have lost the remainder of your turn.
When combat ends, the combat buttons on the interface
bar are covered up again and the game returns to real-
time.

Victorious in Battle and Looting the Dead
Your character will gain a number of experience points
based on the toughness of the critters faced. It may be
enough XP to increase your character’s level, or you may
need to explore some more and face additional challenges.
You can also loot the dead bodies for their stuff.
Left-click, or select the Use action icon, on a dead
body to loot it. A loot screen will appear with your
character on the left-hand side and the dead body on the
right-hand side. If there is more than one dead body on
the hex, there will be some arrows to select the
additional corpses.
There is a TAKE ALL on the loot screen that will move
all items from the corpse or container object to your
character’s inventory. That’s the quick way of grabbing
everything.
You can also use the Unload Ammo action icon on a
weapon in the corpses inventory and it drop the ammo
directly into your inventory.
