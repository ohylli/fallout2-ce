TYPES OF CHARACTERS
============================================================

types of characters in the Fallout world:
Player Character - This is your alternate ego that exists
within the Fallout world. This is the single most
important character in the game. If the player character
(PC) is killed the game is over. PCs are also the most
detailed of all the characters in the game, having access
to all statistics, traits, skills, perks and karmic
slices of life. Grouped together, all those things are
called characteristics.
Non-Player Characters - These are the computer controlled
people in the game. Every character except the PC will be
a non-player character (NPC), by definition. NPCs are not
as detailed as the PC, and only have a limited subset of
characteristics.
Party Members - It is possible for the player to find
NPCs that will join the PC. These are called party
members, since they are a member of your party, or group
of characters. They will follow your character around,
and you have a small amount of control over their
actions, as compared to regular NPCs.
Critters - This term is sometimes used to describe an
NPC, usually a non-intelligent animal or monster, but it
can include any NPC.
