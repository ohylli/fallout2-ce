STATISTICS

Statistics
There are two types of statistics: Primary and Secondary.
Primary statistics are set during character creation and
will rarely change during the course of the game.
Secondary statistics are derived from the primary
statistics.
Primary Statistics
Strength - This statistic is used in the secondary
statistics Carry Weight, Melee Damage, and Hit Points.

All weapons have a minimum Strength requirement, as well.
If your character’s Strength is not high enough to use
the weapon properly, the chance to hit is modified by -
20% for each point of low Strength. A high enough skill
can offset the low Strength modifier. You will be warned
by a message in combat if your character’s ST is too low.
Examine the weapon for more details about its ST
A note about dice rolls.
Dice?  In a computer role-playing game?  Well, Fallout 2 is
a true, back to basics role-playing game.  These games were
originally played, and still are, at a table with paper, pencil,
and dice.  Fallout 2 stays true to those origins.  Some
parts of the manual will refer to rolls.  In this case, Fallout
2 is rolling against one of your characteristics with
“virtual” dice.
There are two types of rolls: checks and results.
Checks are rolls against your characteristics, usually to
see if you can accomplish a particular task (like shooting
someone in the back.)  If the computer rolls below your
characteristic, a statistic or skill, then you succeed.  If
the computer rolls above the characteristic, you fail.  The
computer will roll dice that are appropriate to the
characteristic and there can be modifiers.  There is always
a chance of failure, regardless of how high the
characteristic.  There is not always a chance for success,
especially if you have a particularly low characteristic.
Results are random numbers that are generated when you
succeed or fail at a task.  A result may be the amount of
damage done by a firearm, or how much damage you take
from a trap, or how many hit points you heal by using a
Stimpak.
Fallout 2 will handle all of this for you.  We are telling you
this so you get a better idea of what is happening “under
the hood.”  In addition, a strong understanding of
probabilities will help
you succeed when you play the game.
NOTES

requirement.
Perception - This is used in the Sequence secondary
statistic, and several skills (Lockpick, Traps, First Aid
and Doctor.) The primary use of this statistic is
determing the maximum distance your character can shoot a
ranged weapon effectively. The better the PE score, the
farther your character can shoot. Perception is also used
by the computer to determine if your character notices
the small details, traps and how far away you start from
a random encounter.
Endurance - The Hit Point, Poison Resistance, Radiation
Resistance, and Healing Rate secondary statistics are
based on Endurance, which also modifies the starting
level of your character’s Outdoorsman skill. Endurance is
used by the computer in combat to see if you can resist
the effects of some critical hits (like blows to the
head) and not get knocked down, or knocked out.
Charisma - No secondary statistics are based on Charisma.
It does heavily influence the Barter and Speech skills.
Charisma is used to determine the maximum number of NPCs
that will join your party. You can only have Charisma
divided by two, round down, number of party members. It
is also important in determining the initial reaction of
NPCs to your character. Characters with high Charisma
scores will be better liked. The game will compare your
character’s Charisma to the NPC’s Charisma. NPCs with
high Charisma scores will be more resistant to the charms
of your character.
Agility - This statistic is the basis for the Armour
Class and Action Point secondary statistics. It modifies
the most skills as well, especially combat skills.
Agility is used by the computer whenever your character
must perform some physical act of dexterity (to avoid a
trap, for example.)
Intelligence - No secondary statistics use Intelligence.
Many of the non-combat skills use it for the base values,
however. Intelligence is a very important statistic when
talking to characters. It will determine what you can and

can’t say to NPCs. Characters with high Intelligence
scores will be able to speak intelligently and ask more
profound questions. Intelligence also determines the
number of skill points your character gains each level.
Luck - The Critical Chance secondary statistic is based
on Luck, so is the Gambling skill. Luck is used in combat
to determine how often you get critical hits, and how
good those critical hits are. Luck is also used by the
computer to see if good or bad things happen to you.
Characters with high Luck scores are more likely to come
across special random encounters.
Derived Statistics
Hit Points - This stat determines if your character lives
or dies after being shot in the chest, or takes other
types of damage. Your current and maximum hit points are
shown on the character screen, and the interface bar
shows you your current HP, since it is such an important
stat to see. When your character takes damage, you will
see a message in the display window. For example, “You
are hit for 16 points of damage. Ouch.” If you had 30 HP
when that message came up, you now have 14 HP. See that
message again and you are dead unless you healed some HP
damage. Skills, such as First Aid and Doctor, or healing
items, like Stimpaks, can reduce the amount of HP damage

your character has sustained. You can never “heal” more
damage than your maximum HP total.
Armour Class - This statistic reduces the chance of an
opponent to hit your character during combat. If you have
an AC of 30%, which is pretty high, all characters that
attempt to attack you have a -30% to their chance to hit,
in addition to the other modifiers (such as darkness,
range, and cover.) If you never get hit, there is no
chance of your character taking damage.
Action Points - This is number of actions your character
can take during a single turn of combat. Individual
actions have different AP costs. You can only perform an
action if you have enough AP to cover the cost. Walking,
for example, costs one AP per hex moved. If you have no
AP remaining, you cannot move. The AP cost of using an
item is listed on the active item button on the interface
bar. Other actions are listed in the combat section, on
page 118.
Carry Weight - This is the total amount of weight your
character can carry in her inventory. Almost all items
have a weight, in pounds, which you can discover by doing
an Examine on the item. The total number of items,
multiplied by their weight per item, equals your
character’s total inventory weight. This must be below
your character’s Carry Weight, or when you put an item
down your character may not be able to pick it back up.
Melee Damage - This is the amount of damage added to the
upper end of hand-to-hand and melee attacks. It is
possible to have a Melee Damage of 5 and still do only
one point of damage when you attack, based on armour and
the fact that this stat adds to the maximum amount of
random damage done, not the minimum. If a weapon does 1-4
points of damage (which you can see on the inventory
screen), and your character has a Melee Damage of 2, that
weapon would do 1-6 points of damage before being
modified by the armour of your target.
Damage Resistance - This is the general amount of damage
that your character is strong enough to just shrug off.

Every attack will be reduced by this percentage. In
conjunction with armour, which will have it’s own Damage
Resistance and another stat called Damage Threshold (see
page 135), every attack will do less damage to your
character’s Hit Point total. Example: Your character is
hit for 10
points, a Damage Resistance of 10% would reduce that to 9
points.
Poison Resistance - The amount of poison your character
takes is reduced by this percentage. If your character
takes 20 points of poison, and has a PR of 20%, then the
final amount of poison taken would be 16 points. Over
time, this 16 points will be reduced to 0 and your
character will no longer be affected by poison. The more
points of poison that affects your character, the less
amount of time before you take damage from the poison.
Radiation Resistance - This stat reduces the amount of
radiation your character is exposed to by this
percentage. This stat can be temporarily increased by
taking Rad-X, a chem. Some types of armour will also
affect the amount of radiation damage your character is
exposed to. This statistic will not help against
previously exposed radiation.
Sequence - The greater the value of this statistic, the
more likely your character is to go first in a turn of
combat. Generally, the character that starts combat gets
an action and then all critters that are involved in that
combat are sequenced (get it) into a list. The critter
with the highest Sequence value goes first on the list,
and it works its way down from there. A high Sequence
does not mean that a character gets to go multiple times
before slower Sequenced characters. The larger the
battle, the more opponents, the more valuable this
statistic becomes. As new critters are added to a battle,
they will be sequenced in according to their Sequence
statistic.
Healing Rate - This stat determines the number of Hit
Points healed when your character rests or travels. When
your character rests, and can catch his wind, the current

HP total will be increased by the Healing Rate every
couple of hours. It is only effective when the character
rests or travels. When travelling, healing is slower than
while resting, too, but that usually doesn’t matter since
more time is spent travelling than resting overnight.
Critical Chance - This is the base chance to cause a
critical hit in combat. Characters with high combat
skills, or high quality weapons, will also score more
critical hits. The difference between a successful combat
roll and the proper weapon skill is modified by a formula
and added to the Critical Chance stat. Then another roll
is made, and if it is under the modified Critical Chance,
a critical hit is scored. And that is a completely
different table that depends on the type of critter you
are attacking, and where you hit them.
