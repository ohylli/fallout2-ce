BARTER
============================================================

Barter
Barter is the exchange of goods.
Without a real monetary system,
and a government to back it up,
most people have resorted to
trading goods in order to get by.
To access the bartering
interface, press the BARTER
button from the dialogue screen.
If the character wishes to barter
with you, and most will, then the
barter interface will slide up
and cover the lower section of
the screen.
If you decide to cancel bartering, without making the
deal, press the TALK button. You will be returned to the
normal dialogue screen.
To barter with an NPC, you
must trade an equal amount of
goods. Your Barter skill will
modify the worth of the items in
your inventory, since you will
be better at making them seem
more valuable. A high Barter
skill will give your loot more
value. A low Barter skill means
that you have to give more of
your items to get the same amount of goods from an NPC.
Your inventory list is on the left-hand side of the
screen. The equipment and items that the NPC is willing
to barter away is on the right-hand side of the screen.
The table between the two lists is where the bartering
will actually take place. At the bottom of each side of
the table is the total value for all items that are up
for trade. As you add more items to your side, for
example, the dollar value will rise. The dollar value on
the NPC side of the table shows the total value of all
items that you want to trade for.
How to Barter
Take inventory items that you are willing to give up, or
no longer need, and place them on your side of the table
Barter is
used with non-party-
member NPCs only.  NPCs
that believe in you
enough to join your
cause, and your party,
use a slightly different
method of trading goods.
See page 70 for more
details.
NOTES

(the left.) Take the items
that you want from the NPCs
inventory list and place them
on his side of the table (the
right.) You cannot place
items directly into the other
sides table or inventory
list. That would be a major
no-no. You must use the
table.
If you move multiple items
(like a bunch of ammo or
Stimpaks), then you get the
move multiple item window.
Remember that you can type in
the number of items to move,
in addition to using the +
and - buttons. Typing a large
number of items works well when you are dealing with
cash.
Once you have balanced the two sides of the table with
an equal amount of goods (or if the trade is in the
favour of the NPC), then you can press the OFFER button
to make the offer. If the NPC accepts, the goods will be
exchanged automatically. Your new items will be added to
the top of your inventory list.
If the NPC does not accept the deal, you need to place
more items on your side of the table or remove items from
his side. Remember to watch the dollar values of the
items at the bottom of the trading table. Press the OFFER
button again when you have adjusted the trade.
Price Influences
There are many things that will determine the total value
of your goods compared to what the NPC will barter them
for.
Obviously, your Barter skill is the single most
important factor. Remember, the better your Barter skill,
the more you can get for your items.
The Barter skill of the NPC comes into play. Some NPCs
also just charge more for their goods (shopkeepers for
example.)
Your reputation will modify the value of the trade.
Not all trade is
done by pure barter.  Some
of the towns are printing
money again.  Money makes a
great way to store lots of
value, since it is very light-
weight and takes up no real
room in your inventory.
When you have the chance,
convert your heavy loot into
portable cash.
NOTES

Having a good reputation will give
you a better price break.
The NPCs personal reaction to
your character will also modify the
value of the goods being traded. If
the NPC likes your character, she is
more likely to give your character a
break and a better deal.
If you offer a really poor trade,
it may actually insult the NPC and
lower their opinion of your
character.
