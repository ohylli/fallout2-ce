Maps
The game view just shows a small section of the Fallout 2
world. There are three different types of maps besides
the game view that show the world at different scales.
From largest to smallest:
World Map
Town Map
Game View
Automap
World Map
The largest map in the game,
the world map shows an overland
view of the wasteland. You will
use this map to move your
character from town to town. You
can only get to the world map by
exiting a town via an “exit
grid.” This is an example of
what an exit grid looks like:
Note that there are two types of exit grids. Green exit
grids take you from one part of a town to another, and
brown exit grids take you to the world map. Step on the
exit grid to be automatically transported. You can use an
exit grid to escape from a hostile location, but don’t
expect a pleasant welcome when you return.
The world map is divided into four different sections:
Leaving
the map via an exit
grid is a great way
to end combat!
NOTES

Map Display - This is the view
of the map. Areas that you have
not explored are dark. The
immediate area around your
explorations is slightly
illuminated. This means that
your character has seen the
contents of that area, but has
not yet walked through that
part of the world map. Green
circles are important locations, towns usually, that you
can visit. Large green circles have their own town map
(see below.)
Sun/Moon Display - You can see the current date and time
through this indicator. This display will also show you
if it is day or night at your current spot on the world
map. Notice that as you move, the sun sets and rises.
Many towns change depending on whether it is day or night
when you arrive.
Location List - As you discover important locations, a
button for that location will be added to this list. If
you ever want to visit a known location, simply click on
that locations button and your character will start
marching there immediately. You can scroll this list, if
necessary.
Town/World Button - This button will toggle between the
town and world maps.
World Map Movement
To move around the world, move your cursor over your
intended destination and click. Your character will begin
moving there immediately. Movement is not instantaneous
and may take days or weeks of game time. As you explore,
darkened areas of the world map will be revealed.
You can also use the location list to select a
previously visited location to head for.
When you reach your destination, a green triangle will
appear. Click on the triangle to enter that location. You
can always click on a new destination, if you want to
keep exploring.

The world of the wasteland is a difficult place to
travel in. You have two obstacles -- terrain and random
encounters. Either or both of these can slow down your
travelling and make your life difficult.
Terrain
Some terrain is more difficult to travel through than
others. There are four basic types of terrain:
Mountain - The most difficult to move through. Mountain
areas will force your character to move the slowest.
Desert - This terrain is hot and dry. Movement is normal,
however.
City - Walking through this terrain is usually the
fastest way to travel. Even with the ruins, cities are
the easiest to travel through.
Coastland - Similar to desert terrain. Movement is
normal.
Random Encounters
When you are travelling on the world map, it is still
possible to encounter other travellers or dangerous
animals. These are known as random encounters, since you
are never sure what you will be coming across, or when.
Some areas of the map may have more encounters than
others. Random encounters are usually hostile, but not
always.
Depending on your Outdoorsman skill, some Perks and
whether or not you have the Motion Sensor, you may be
able to detect a random encounter before it detects you.
In this case, you are given the option of bypassing the
encounter and continuing your journey, or going ahead
with the encounter.
Town Map
The town map is a detailed representation of an important
location, usually a town (thus the name.) Town maps give
you an idea of what the location is, where the major
buildings or points of interest within that location are,

and a quick way of jumping into a town once you have
explored it.
To access a town map, click on the TOWN/WORLD button
on the world map. One of the locations (most likely the
most previously visited location) is displayed. To change
town maps, click on a known location button in the
location list. You can only view town maps for places
that you have visited.
The green triangles function just like the ones on the
world map do. Click on one of them to jump to that part
of town. To help you remember what triangle is associated
with what part of that location, move the cursor over a
triangle marker to reveal the marker name.
Automap
An automap is a shrunken view of a
game view map. It is shrunken so
you can see all of that map at
once. The PIPBoy 2000 records all
automaps, and can give you access
to any automap that you have
visited. To access the automap for
the map your character is
currently on, press the MAP button
on the interface bar.
The automap is a window that
appears. Only the current level of
the map you are on is displayed. All other levels (like
the basement of a building, or a second story) are
displayed through the PIPBoy.
Notice that the automap only displays large objects,
like walls and buildings. The function of an automap is
to help you find your way around town.
Your current location is marked with a solid red
cross. Exit grids are orange.
If you have the Motion Sensor as an active item, you
can press the SCANNER button to reveal other critters
within the automap. All other critters show up as red
dots. You can only scan maps that your character is
currently on.
The HI/LO toggle button will change between high and
low resolution. At high resolution, more detail is
displayed on the map. Low resolution easier to read on

some cluttered maps.
Press the CANCEL button to return to the game.
