Skills
Skills are learned abilities of your character. The skill
level shows how good your character is at that skill.
Each skill will have its own skill level, which is
expressed as a percentage. That percentage shows your
chance of success, before modifiers. No skill is 100%
certain, however, and all skills max out at 95% (after
modifiers.)
The maximum skill level is 200%. Skill levels can be
increased everytime your character gains a level, but it
starts getting harder and harder to improve well-known
skills. Skills can also be improved by reading specific
books or completing quests within the game.
Small Guns - Firearms covered by the use of this skill:
pistols (both revolvers and autoloaders), sub-machineguns
(SMGs), rifles, and shotguns. The skill level is your
base percentage to hit. Modifiers include: weapon weight,
range, darkness, and cover. This skill is used
automatically in combat when you attack with the
appropriate weapon.
Big Guns - Similar to Small Guns, but this skill affects
much bigger weapons: rocket launcher, mini-gun, flamer,
and other large weapons. This skill is used automatically

in combat when you attack with the appropriate weapon.
Energy Weapons - Also like Small Guns, but it affects any
ranged weapon that uses energy cells instead of
conventional chemical propellants. This skill is used
automatically in combat when you attack with the
appropriate weapon.
Unarmed - The skill of punching and kicking. Very few
weapons will also use this skill (the armed version of
Unarmed), like Brass Knuckles. You must not have an
active item in one of your slots to use this skill to
its full ability, however. ITEM1 is for punch attacks.
ITEM2 covers using your feet (don’t ask, it involves some
weird yoga practice.) Your character starts by just being
able to punch or kick, but there are more unarmed
techniques than that. As your character’s characteristics
improve, the type of unarmed attack will change. These
improvements are automatic, as long as the requirements
are met. There are two different modes for each type of
attack. Right-click on the Punch or Kick button to change
the mode from primary to secondary. The Unarmed skill is
automatically used when you attack.

Melee Weapons - This covers the use of most melee
weapons. Knives, spears, hammers are all melee weapons.
The skill level is the base chance to hit your opponent,
modified by your opponent’s armour class. Melee weapons
have a greater chance of doing a critical hit. This skill
is used automatically when you attack with a melee
weapon.
Throwing - Whenever a weapon is thrown, this skill gets
used. Knives are melee weapons, but if you throw a dagger
at your opponent, this skill will be used. Grenades are a
good reason to improve this skill. If you miss, the
thrown object still has to end up somewhere. It’s
possible to throw a weapon and have it land right at your
feet. If it’s a knife, no big deal. If it is grenade,
that’s a really big deal. The maximum distance a weapon
can be thrown is based on your character’s Strength. This

skill is used automatically when you attempt to throw a
weapon.
First Aid - The skill can heal minor wounds only. When
used successfully, it will heal a small amount
of Hit Point damage. It can only be used a few times a
day. This skill takes a few minutes to use, so it will
advance the game clock by a few minutes.
If you use a First Aid kit, you will increase your
chance of successfully using this skill. Using a First
Aid kit on a person will automatically use your First Aid
skill (with a positive modifier) on that person. The
supplies in a First Aid kit will eventually run out and
the item will be automatically discarded.
Doctor - This skill heals major wounds. Not only does it
heal more HP damage than First Aid, it can also restore a
crippled limb to full health (see page 53 for information
about crippled limbs.) Like the First Aid skill, it can
only be used successfully a few times a day. If all the
uses of one of the healing skills are used up, it is
still possible to use the other healing skill until it
runs out of uses as well. Using this skill will advance
the game clock by several hours.
Using a Doctor’s Bag will increase your chance of
successfully using this skill.

Sneak - Sneaking makes it
harder for your character to
be detected. Using this skill
is a toggle. You are either
Sneaking, or you are not.
When you are Sneaking, you
don’t actually know if the
skill is working properly.
When you first start
Sneaking, and every minute
after, the computer rolls
against your Sneak skill. If
successful, all critters will
have their Perception halved
when trying to notice you.
Normally, if your character runs, it will automatically
turn Sneak off. You can tell if your character is trying
to use this skill if the Sneak icon is displayed above
the interface bar.
Lockpick - When you use this skill on a locked door or
container, the computer will roll against your Lockpick
skilled modified by the difficulty of the lock. If
successful, the lock will be picked. If you fail, you
just lose the time spent trying to pick the lock. If you
critically fail, the lock is jammed and cannot be picked
until a long period of time has passed. Every attempt
takes a few game minutes.
A lockpick can be used to increase the chance of
success. There are two different types of locks:
mechanical and electronic. Use the proper lockpick for
the type of lock. Lockpicks cannot be “used” up, but they
can be broken or destroyed on a critical failure.
Steal - The skill level of Steal determines the base
chance of “removing” an item from another person or
object without being noticed. Modifiers include: the
facing of the target compared to your character (standing
right in front of the target is a bad idea), the size of
the object you are trying to steal (smaller objects are
easier to steal than larger objects), and the number of
You can
actually use the Steal skill
to plant items on a target.
Just drag from your
character’s inventory to
theirs.  They get a chance
to notice what you are
doing, of course.  It works
just like a normal Steal, but
in reverse.
NOTES

objects you are trying to steal at one time (stealing a
small number of objects is easier than stealing
everything a person owns.) When you use this skill on a
person, you will see a loot screen. Drag as many items as
you want from the target’s inventory to your inventory.
Each item you move will create an opportunity for the
target to notice what you are doing. Their chance to
notice your Steal action depends on your skill, the
result of the Steal roll after all the modifiers, and
their Perception. The higher their Perception, the more
likely they are to notice your character if she screws
up.
Traps - This skill is used to spot, disarm, and plant
traps and explosives. If you attempt to use a trapped
item, you will have a chance to notice the trap based on
your Traps skill or Perception (depends on the trap.) If
you do not notice the trap, it will go off in your face.
You can use the Traps skill to attempt to disarm the
trap. If you succeed, the trap is disarmed. If you fail,
you can always try again. If you critically fail, the
trap goes off in your face. If you find a trap trigger
on the floor, you will see the trigger appear. Use the
Traps skill on the trigger to attempt to disarm it. If
you find a trap on a container, or door, then you see a
message in the display window. If you were attempting to
open the trapped container or door, Fallout will stop
you. Try again and you can set off the trap. The Traps
skill is also used when you set and place explosives. To
use dynamite, for example, do the following:
Open inventory.
Select the explosive and Use
it.
A timer will appear. Set the
time you would like the
explosive to go off. A Traps
roll will be made. If you
succeed, the trap will go off
on time. If you fail, the trap
will go off before you intended it to. If you critically
fail, the trap goes off immediately.
This is the timer. Use the + and - buttons to adjust

the time. Press DONE when the time is set to your
satisfaction. Press CANCEL to not set the timer on the
explosive. Once you start a timer, you cannot stop the
explosive from detonating.
You can use an explosive to trap a door or container
item. Simply use an explosive that is not currently on a
timer on the door or container. The game will roll your
Traps skill and, if things go well, the next person to
open that door will get a major case of concussion and
blast damage.
Science - This skill is really used in two different
ways. The active use of this skill is mostly used on
computers and hi-tech pieces of equipment. This skill is
also used passively to determine whether or not your
character can understand or notice something scientific.
This skill covers all the different types of scientific
fields. Using this skill generally takes no game time.
This skill often needs to be used before the Repair
skill. It will give you a general idea of what is wrong.
Repair - Use this skill to fix something that is broken,
or break something that is fixed. Using the proper tool
for the job will help increase the chance of success. The
use of this skill will really depend on the situation you
come across in the game. Some items may be easier than
others to fix.
Speech - This skill is only used in extended dialogues
(see page 66.) Besides being used to present a convincing
argument, and getting the NPC to agree with you, it is
used to present a convincing lie and getting the NPC to
agree with you. The difference between an argument and a
lie is that if you blow the argument, the NPC generally
will not want to slit your throat. You never get to use
this skill actively while talking, as the lines that
Speech rolls are used on are not marked. A higher Speech
skill is useful for getting your way. You can use the
Speech skill actively to start a conversation, but just
clicking on the person is usually easier to do.
Barter - The skill of trading goods is used automatically
in the barter screen (see page 68.) Your Barter skill,

along with many other factors, will be used to set the
value of any goods that you are attempting to trade. The
only game effect of this skill is to increase the value
of your goods (and to meet the requirement of a few
Perks.)
Gambling - Games of chance will always exist. Whenever
you come across a game of chance, this skill will be used
to determine whether your character wins or loses. This
skill is used automatically when you decide to have your
character gamble in the game.
Outdoorsman - This is used mostly on the World Map. It
will determine if you can avoid a random encounter. It is
also used to determine how far away from a critter you
start a random encounter, along with your character’s
Perception statistic. The Outdoorsman skill may also be
used in specific encounters. Outdoorsman is never used
actively.
