PERKS
============================================================

Perks

Perks are special abilities that your character can
occasionally select when your
character gains an experience
level. These rewards are
similar to traits, except
everything is good. No bad
stuff here.
You can select one Perk
every three levels (starting at level 3 -- so level 3, 6,
9, 12, 15, 18 and so on) unless you have the Skilled
trait, who get a Perk every four levels (level 4, 8, 12,
16, 20 and so on.)
The list of Perks that you can choose from are based
on your character’s characteristics. Some Perks are only
available if your character is of high enough level, for
example. Your character must meet or exceed all of the
requirements. Some Perks have no requirements. The
requirements for a Perk are listed below.
You will have the opportunity to pick a Perk when you
enter the character screen after achieving a level that
grants you a Perk. You may choose not to pick a Perk,
but if you don’t select one before the next Perk-granting
level, you lose the Perk. You can only have one Perk at
most to pick.
The Perk selection window will show all the Perks that
are available to your character. You can select a Perk to
read about it on the information card. Use the arrow
buttons to scroll the list. Press the DONE button to take
the highlighted Perk. Press the CANCEL button to hold off
and pick the Perk the next time you enter the character
screen.
Some Perks can be selected multiple times. The maximum
number of times the Perk can be selected is the number of
ranks that Perk has. The number of ranks is also listed
below.
Perks that increase a skill will increase the skill by
a number of skill points. These work just like normal
skill points. Thus, if your characters base skill is
pretty high, the increase will be smaller than if the
base skill was low.
The list of Perks is organised alphabetically.
