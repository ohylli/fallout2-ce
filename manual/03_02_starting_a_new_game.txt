STARTING A NEW GAME
============================================================

Starting a
New Game
When you first start
playing Fallout 2, you
will need to start a
new game. This will
start you off with a
new character at the
beginning of the story.
A character is a
representative of you,
the player, in the
story. The character
will be your alter-ego,
and follow your
commands and pay the
consequences for those actions. Obviously, your
character is the single most important facet of the
game and you should spend some time deciding what
kind of character to play.
The decision about your
character is the most
important decision you
have to make at the start
of the game.
There are two ways to
decide on a character:
select a pre-generated
character or create your
own. Both ways have their
pluses and minuses, and we’ll leave the choice up
to you.
When you click on NEW GAME from the Main Menu,
you will see the character selection screen. This
screen will always display one of three pre-
generated characters. Besides a picture of the pre-
generated character, you will see a brief summary
of their primary statistics and their biography.
You have four choices on this screen to choose
from.
You can bypass
a movie in Fallout 2 by
pressing the space bar or
the ESC key.  You should not
do this until you have viewed
the movie at least once.
Important information and
background story is often
conveyed via a movie.
Besides, they look good.
NOTES

NEW CHARACTER - Go immediately to
the character creation screen and
do not start the game until you
are done there. This basically
gives you complete control of your
character, but at the cost of a
little more time before you can
begin playing. Some players like
to investigate the game a little
with a pre-generated character and
then restart and create their own
character then. More advanced
players can jump right into the
character creation screen. This is
probably the most emotionally
satisfying way to select a character. See page 20 for
information on the character creation screen.
SELECT CHARACTER - Take the currently selected pre-
generated character and start the game immediately. This
is the fastest choice, as it will get you into the game
in the shortest amount of time. This choice is
recommended for beginning players. See page 19 for a
brief bio on each of the pre-generated characters.
MODIFY CHARACTER - Take the currently selected pre-
generated character and go to the character creation
screen. This is a compromise between NEW CHARACTER and
SELECT CHARACTER. Once on the character creation screen,
you will see the statistics and skills of the pre-
generated character. You can then modify that character
to suit your own nefarious needs.
CANCEL - Return to the Main Menu without starting a new
game or selecting a character.
You can use
the left and right
arrow buttons
underneath the
character portrait to
change between the
three pre-generated
characters.
