RANGED WEAPONS
============================================================

Ranged Weapons
Weapons that can be used a range of one hex, two hexes
or more are called ranged weapons. They often have some
sort of finite range, but that is often 15, 20 or more
hexes away.
Anything from a gun to a thrown rock can be a ranged
weapon. If you can attack farther than two hexes away, it
must be a ranged weapon.
Weapon Modes
By right-clicking on the active item button, you can
chance the weapon mode. Not all weapons will have all
modes.
SINGLE - This will fire one shot from the weapon. One
round of ammo will be used. The computer will roll one
chance to hit. If it succeeds, the shot hits and does
damage. If it fails, nothing happens except you spent
some APs that could have been better used.
Single shots may also be targeted, if your character
does not have the Fast Shot trait. The targeting symbol
will appear in the lower right-hand corner of the active
item button when you are in targeted shot mode. See page
126 for more info on these kinds of attacks.

BURST - This mode will use
multiple rounds of ammunition.
Every type of burst weapon will
have a different rate of fire
(ROF), which determines the
number of rounds fired with a
single action. Burst weapons use ammo faster, but
generally have a better chance to hit overall.
Every single bullet will get an individual chance to
hit. Even with a low skill, burst weapons with a high ROF
will usually hit something.
And something is the key word. Burst weapons not only
attack the target, but any other potential target with
the cone shaped area of effect.
A burst is capable of covering many hexes and hitting
all targets within that area. Most of the bullets are
aimed at the primary target. The rest of the bullets can
strike anybody within the cone. Friends, enemy’s,
helpless sheep, whatever is in the cone that is centred
around your target. Each bullet will do the weapons
listed amount of damage. If all rounds hit, a burst
weapon can do an awful lot of damage.
However, if are right on top of an enemy, and you
burst them -- they will be riddled by all the bullets.
The cone needs a minimum of a few hexes to work.
Besides potentially using a lot of ammo, burst shots
may not be targeted. You just don’t have the fine control
necessary to bring the sight to target with all the
recoil.
THROW - This will toss the
weapon at the enemy target. This
is generally a shorter ranged
attack than other ranged
weapons. The exact range will
depend on the Strength statistic
of the character throwing the weapon.
Grenades, knives and rocks can all be thrown. If you
have an identical item in your inventory, it will
automatically be loaded into the same slot. This lets you
toss frag grenades like they are going to nuke the
factory in five minutes and you’d better use all that you
can.

All thrown weapons have to land somewhere. Even if a
thrown weapon misses the target, it will land on the
ground somewhere around you or the target. Grenades have
a tendency to do bad things if this happens.
RELOAD - Weapons that require ammo can be reloaded. You
must have the identical kind of ammo in your inventory.
The weapon will be maxed out, or all of your inventory
ammo will be used, whichever comes first.
The ammo bar next to the active item button shows if a
weapon requires ammo, and how close it is to needing a
reload. The lower the bar, the more likely you will be
reloading in the very near future. Burst weapons that
have a high ROF use a lot of ammo. Single-shot weapons,
like rocket launcher’s, also need to be reloaded quite
often.
Besides using this method to reload, which only costs
two AP, you can spend four AP and open inventory. Once in
inventory, you can perform as many inventory actions as you
would like. Including swapping weapons, ammo type, using
healing items and so on.
Examine the weapon in inventory to get an exact count
of the remaining ammo, if you are interested.
