Main Game Screen
This is the screen that you
spend the majority of your time
using. It shows your character
and a view of the world around
him or her.

The screen is divided into two sections: the game view
and the interface bar.
The game view is the upper part of the screen where
the action takes place. Your character, and the non-
player characters (NPCs) inhabit this part of the screen.
It is in the game view that you perform most of your
actions: moving around, grabbing items, talking to
people, targeting enemy critters in combat, opening
doors, exploring, and more.
The bottom part of the screen is the interface bar.
You will use the interface bar to perform game-related
activities: accessing inventory, selecting a weapon or
weapon mode to attack with, accessing the character
screen, selecting options, getting feedback from the
display window, and more.
Using your mouse, you will perform actions using
different types of cursors.
