PRE-GENERATED CHARACTERS
============================================================

Pre-generated Characters
If you don’t want to spend a lot of time at the
beginning of the game before you get to play, then start
here. Pick one of the three pre-generated characters and
hop right into the action. Some players will want to
experience the game for a little while before creating
their own character, and others will want to see the game
to completion using any character. These three characters
are all capable of finishing the Fallout 2 adventure.
Pick the character that you like the most and start
playing immediately!
Mingan
Mingan’s whisper-soft tread and
acquisitive fingers have always
aided his natural curiosity.
Several years ago the tribe
decided that Mingan’s talents
would be best used on someone
else. Since then Mingan has been
the tribe’s most accomplished
scout. However, the tents of nearby tribes provide little
challenge these days. It’s time to scout farther afield.
Mingan is a thief character. Players that would like
to sneak around, and “liberate” items from other
characters should select Mingan.
Chitsa
Chitsa has always been able to
convince others to do things her
way. Her winning personality and
stunning good looks, have often
caused others to underestimate the
tribe’s best trader. In the
course of her frequent journeys,
Chitsa has learned to deal with
the perils of travelling the Wastes. Now the tribe needs
help and new paths beckon to Chitsa.
Chitsa is a diplomat character. If you would like to
talk to people and wring the most information from them
without having to resort to violence all the time, then

you should select Chitsa.
Narg
Narg’s exceptional physique has
made him one of the best hunters
in the tribe. Narg’s first, and
usually only, impulse is to crush
anything that he can’t figure
out. Narg has become quite adept
at crushing, and slicing, and
dicing. Narg would like to prove
his worthiness to lead the tribe and he’ll let nothing
stand in his way.
Narg is a barbarian fighter. If you want to cause the
most damage, select Narg.
Modifying Pre-generated Characters
From the main menu, one of the options is to MODIFY
CHARACTER. This will let you load the statistics for the
currently selected character into the character creation
screen. Here you can modify the character to your heart’s
content, or just look at the character detail.
