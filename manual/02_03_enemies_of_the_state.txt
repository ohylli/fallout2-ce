Enemies of the State
While the Overseer was obviously happy to see me returned
to the Vault, alive and with the necessary water-chip, he
was distraught at my description of the super mutants. It
is here that I realised the mistake I had made with the
water-merchants. I had pointed them, and others, in the
direction of our home. Without the protection of
anonymity, the Vault could easily have been destroyed.
The knowledge of the fate of Vault-15 did not help.
The Overseer tasked me with a new mission. Find and
destroy the danger of the super mutants.
Once again, I left the Vault. This time, it was was
easier on my heart. Looking back now, I realise it was
also the first time I should have seen the true hearts of
the other vault-dwellers and the Overseer.
I returned to the Hub, looking for clues. Some time
was spent there, and I discovered a shady underworld
amongst the hustle and bustle of that large city. They
thought they could manipulate me, but I proved them wrong
and used the crooks instead. I did rescue a young man who
belonged to the Brotherhood of Steel. A few trouble-
makers tried to stop me, but I learned much about
survival since leaving the Vault.
It was in my best interest to leave town for a while.
I journeyed to this Brotherhood. Thinking they would have
the knowledge I sought, I tried to join them. They
required me to go on a quest before they would let me
in. Thinking it would be a short and easy quest, I agreed
and set off for the place they called the Glow. The
horror of atomic war was never so obvious to me until
then.
The Brotherhood was surprised to see me, and even more
surprised to see that I had not only survived their
quest, but succeeded. They gave me the information I
required and some of their technology, and I set off in
search of the Boneyard.

On my way, I took a detour and stopped by Necropolis
in order to see some old friends. Unfortunately, that
place was now truly the city of the dead. All the ghouls
had been slaughtered. Large mutants roamed the streets. I
found one survivor who told me that the mutants had
attacked shortly after I had left. Before he died, the
ghoul told me that the mutants were looking for pure
strain humans, and one in particular. The ghoul’s
description of the mutants’ special target fit me
perfectly. It was with a heavy heart and a cold burning
on my soul that I continued on to Boneyard.
