COMMAND CURSOR
============================================================

Command Cursor
The command cursor is the way of telling your character to
interact with the environment and other people. Right-
click until the command cursor is displayed.
Use this cursor to point to an object or person that
you wish to interact with. If you move the cursor over an
object or person, and let it rest for a brief moment, an
icon will appear next to the command cursor. This icon
will tell you what the default action is if you left-
click the mouse button while the cursor is over this
object or person. You do not have to wait for the icon
to appear before you click! To perform the default
action, left-click once.
To perform another action instead of the default
action, move the command cursor over an object or person,
and left-click and hold. You must hold the left mouse
button until a list of action icons appears. One of the
action icons will be highlighted. Move the mouse up and
down to change the highlighted action icon. Release the
left mouse button to perform the highlighted action. The
bottom action icon will always be Cancel (see below.)
Pausing the command cursor over an object or person
will also display the name of the object or person in the
display window on the interface bar. To get more

information about that item or critter, use the Examine
action icon (see below as well.)
Action Icons
USE ITEM/GET
Performing this action will attempt to pick up a small
item (like a rock) or manipulate a large item (like a
door.) You can only pick up inventory items, and you can
only use scenery items. If you have enough room in your
inventory, the item you pick up will be added to the top
of your inventory. If you Get a dead body, you will have
a chance to loot them for all they were worth.
You can get inventory items, loot dead bodies, and use
scenery items.
EXAMINE
Using this action will give you more detail about an
object or person. You will get a longer description of
the item or person, often with important information
(like how much ammo is left in a gun, or how wounded a
person appears to be.) In the main game view, this long
description will appear in the display window. In
Inventory, this long description appears in the character
display window.
You can examine almost anything in Fallout 2.
USE SKILL ON
To use one of your active skills on the targeted
object or person, select this action icon. The skilldex
will be displayed and you can select one of the skills.
Some skills will not work on the targeted object or
person (trying to Lockpick a screaming mad ganger is
pretty silly.)
You can use this action on any object or person that a
skill can be used on.
DROP ITEM
Only available in Inventory. If you no longer want to
carry an inventory item, especially if it is getting a
little crowded in your back pocket, or wherever you keep
all those guns and ammo, then use this action on an item.
The dropped item will appear at your feet. Use this
action carefully, since the dropped item may disappear

from that location at a later date. If you drop a really
important item, it may be possible that you cannot finish
the game.
This works on any item in your Inventory.
ROTATE CHARACTER
To rotate your character clockwise, use this action
icon. Every click of the mouse will rotate your character
one hex-side. There is no Action Point cost for this
action in combat. Your character will automatically
rotate to face the proper direction for most actions that
you peform.
This action icon only works on your character.
TALK
Use this action to start talking with an intelligent
creature, or at least make the attempt to open
communication. It also works on some computers, but not
all. If a person has little to say, it will appear over
their head in the main game view. If they want to
actually listen to what you have to say, then it will
open the Dialogue screen and you will be able to carry on
an extended conversation with them. See page 64 for more
information on the Dialogue screen.
This action icon works on people, intelligent
creatures and some computers.

USE INVENTORY ITEM ON
If you want to use an item from your Inventory on a
person or object, then this action is the fastest way to
accomplish that task. When you select this action icon on
a legal target, a small version of your Inventory will
appear. Scroll through your Inventory, if necessary, and
select the item you wish to use, and your character will
attempt to use it on the target. Obviously, the item must
be appropriate. Using a stimpak on a door isn’t going to
do much, while those lockpicks have little chance when
used on a dog (unless it is a really weird dog.) This
action does not Barter or Trade with a person. You must
do that through the Dialogue screen.
This action will work on people, critters and scenery
objects.
UNLOAD AMMO
If you want to remove ammo from a weapon, use this
action icon. It will work in the Inventory screen and the
loot screen, when you are pilfering from the dead. You
can use this action to remove the valuable ammo from the
heavy gun, or change ammo types in your favourite
firearm. The ammo will be added to the top of your
inventory.
This action icon only works on weapons that contain
ammunition, and only in the Inventory and loot screens.
PUSH
Select this action icon when the screen is crowded and
your path is blocked. It will ask all nearby critters to
move out of your way. Some will respond, but others,
especially guards, will not follow your directions. If
that door is blocked by Ivan the Slow-witted, then this
is your command.
Only available on your character, and only affects
some nearby people and critters.
CANCEL
If you do not want to perform any of the above actions
on the target, select the cancel action and it will be as
if nothing happened. This is always the bottom action
icon.
Always available, from everywhere to everything.
