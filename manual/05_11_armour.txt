ARMOUR
============================================================

Armour
Armour is protective clothing that can reduce the effect
of damage in combat. It is highly suggested that you find
armour, wear it and upgrade whenever possible.
The better the armour, the more damage it can protect
against. There are three different statistics that
determine the quality of the armour and how much damage
it can stop.

Armour Class - This is the chance that the armour will
force the attack to miss, usually by deflecting the shot.
The higher the Armour Class (AC), the better the armour.
The AC acts as a negative modifier on the attackers
chance to hit. Example: A ganger is wearing Leather
armour, which is AC15. A desert ranger has a to hit
chance of 65%, after all other modifiers. The chance to
hit the target is only 50%.
Damage Threshold - If a character in armour is hit, then
the first thing armour can do is block the damage. Damage
Threshold (DT) is subtracted from the initial amount of
damage (what the target would take if it weren’t for the
armour.) Example: The desert ranger hits the ganger from
the above example. The attack does 20 points of damage.
Owie! The DT of Leather armour is 4. The first four
points of the rangers attack is stopped cold, leaving
only 16 points of damage.
Damage Resistance - The armour can also absorb the energy
of the attack and spread it out over a larger area,
reducing the damage proportionally. Damage Resistance
(DR) is the percentage of damage, after the DT, that the
attack is reduced by. Example: The ganger is in hurt
shape. Fortunately, Leather armour has a DR of 20%, which
reduces the 16 points of damage to 13 points. Here’s the
math: 16 - (16 x .2 = 3.2 (round down to 3)) = 13. The
Leather armour stopped a little over a third of the total
damage.
