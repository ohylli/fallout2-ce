APPENDIX 2:
Hints and Tips
In addition to the tutorial found in Appendix 1, here are
some basic hints and tips for beginners.
Save Often
Use the save game feature often and use it well. Do
not save over your previous save game slot. Use all 10
slots, alternating between them to protect your character
and your game.
Examine Everything
Keep a close eye on the screen. Examine everyone and
everything until you get a hang of the world. The dirt,
as it were, is in the details.
Concentrate on your Character
At the beginning of the game, when every level counts,
spend your skill points in what your character does well.
This means that you should improve your tag skills until
they are very useful. Master a few skills first and then
improve the rest of your character. All characters should
have at least one combat tag skill (Melee and Unarmed
work best for starting characters, Small Guns is always
useful and the others can be improved later when you
start getting the better equipment.)
Pay Attention
If an NPC says something, they probably mean it. It
may be a lie or a trap, but your character should always
pay attention to what someone has to say.
Save!
We did mention to save your game, right?
Combat Hints
Move around. Don’t stand still. Action Points are
better spent on moving farther away from an attacker than
the AC bonus. Especially if you have a ranged weapon and
they do not. Moving around also allows you to use cover.
Pick your targets carefully and then follow through on

the attack.
Always use Inventory wisely for reloading and healing
your character.
Ammo can be scarce. Conserve it if possible. Melee
weapons and hand-to-hand attacks on small, pitiful
critters can save you some expensive ammo. Don’t be
afraid to spend ammo if it means less danger to your
character, however.
Get some Friends (NPCs, that is)
Having additional NPC party-members is great. Not only
can they offer additional information, but they do the
following:
* Split enemy attacks in combat. More targets for the
enemy means less people actively trying to kill your
character.
* Carry goods. More NPCs mean that you can lug more
stuff around.
* Some NPCs are very skilled, and it will effectively
mean that your character gains a lot of experience as
long as you have these skilled NPCs around.
