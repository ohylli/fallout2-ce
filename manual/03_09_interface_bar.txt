INTERFACE BAR
============================================================

Interface Bar
The bottom part of the
main game screen is
taken up by the
Interface Bar. Don’t
worry, this is a good thing. The Interface Bar looks like
this:
The Interface Bar allows you to give many different
types of commands, and see feedback on how your character
is performing.
If you have a special cursor, like a combat targeting
cursor, or a skill target cursor, and you move it over
the Interface Bar, the cursor will disappear and change
into the normal pointer. This will cancel your weapon
attack or skill use. You will have to re-select that
action if you still want to perform it.
The Interface Bar is made up of the following
components:
Display Monitor - This monitor
prints out feedback as you or
other characters perform
actions. These little messages
are important, so try not to
miss any. Fortunately, you can
scroll back to older messages by
moving the cursor over the display until if changes into
a small arrow. At the top of the display, it will be an
up arrow and left-clicking will scroll back to older
messages. At the bottom of the display, the arrow points
down and left-clicking will scroll to the newer messages.
If older messages are being displayed when a new message
is printed, the display will automatically jump to the
most recent message.

Switch Active Item Button - You can have two items
prepared to immediate use. These are your active items.
You prepare these items in the Inventory screen (see page
45) when you place items into the ITEM1 and ITEM2 slots.
This button will toggle between the two items,
effectively changing the Active Item Button (see below.)
If ITEM1 is being displayed, clicking this button will
switch it to ITEM2. And if ITEM2 is the Active Item,
clicking this button will switch it to ITEM1.
Inventory Button - Pressing this button, cleverly marked
INV, will open the Inventory screen. If you do this
before combat, it is free. If you do this during combat,
it will cost you Action Points. Moral of the story: use
Inventory outside of combat if you can help it. See page
45 for what you can actually do on the Inventory screen.
Action Points - This row of lights will tell you how many
Action Points you have remaining. Action Points are only
used in combat, during which time they will glow. Glowing
lights mean that it is currently combat and currently
your turn. When you use Action Points, the lights will
blink off one at a time. When you get your full
complement of Action Points at the start of a combat
turn, the row of lights will light back up. While it is
possible to have more than ten Action Points, only the
first ten Action Points are actually displayed with this
monitor. The lights will not start to blink off until you
actually start using your last ten Action Points.
Options Button - This button will display a list of
options available as you play Fallout 2:
SAVE GAME - This button will display the Save Game
screen, where you can save your progress. This
allows you to return to the game at a later date or
restore any progress you have made in case of death or
Other Nasty Things. See page 76.
LOAD GAME - This will allow you to load a previously
saved game by displaying the Load Game screen. See page
78.
PREFERENCES - This button displays the Preferences

screen, where you can alter the way Fallout 2 plays. See
page 79.
EXIT - Quit the current game and return
to the main menu. You may want to save
your game before you do this, so Fallout
2 will remind you before you actually go
back to the main menu.
DONE - Return to your current game of
Fallout 2.
Active Item Button - This is where the
current active item is displayed. You can
have two items prepared, ITEM1 and ITEM2. See the Switch
Active Item button (above) for details on how to switch
items.
Left-clicking this button will use the active item or
weapon. Right-clicking this large button will switch
weapon modes.
Besides the graphic of the current active item or
weapon, additional important information is also
displayed on this button.
The Action Point (AP) cost to use this item or weapon
in combat is displayed in the lower left-hand corner. In
combat, if you do not have more AP than this number, you
may not use this item or weapon until you gain additional
AP.
The mode, or how this item will be used, is displayed
in the upper right-hand corner of the button. You can
sometimes right-click to change this mode.

Some weapons can also make targeted shots. If you do
not have the Fast Shot trait, you will see a targeted
shot icon appear in the lower right-hand corner as you
switch modes on the weapon. If you have selected the Fast
Shot trait for your character, you cannot make targeted
shots, and you will never see the targeted shot icon.
Ammo Bar - If the active item is
a weapon that requires ammo, or
an item that requires charges,
then this bar will be displayed
next to the active item button.
This bar will give you a rough
idea of how many shots or uses
remain, before the weapon or
item runs dry.
If the bar is full, stretching
from the top to the bottom of
the button, then the ammo or
charges are maxed out. As you
use rounds of ammo, or charges
of energy, the bar will drop.
When you are dry, the bar will
disappear completely.
For more detailed
information about the number of rounds or charges
remaining, use an Examine on the weapon or item.
Hit Point Counter - This counter displays your current
Hit Points (HP) remaining. The colour of the counter will
give you a rough idea of your current health:
WHITE - Healthy
YELLOW - Hurt
RED 
- About to Die
If your HP ever reach 0, you die and the game ends.
You will have to reload a previously saved game, or start
the game over from the very beginning. You should save
often, and in different save game slots, to make sure
that you don’t have to start over from the very
beginning. You should monitor this display, and use
skills or items to increase your HP when they get low.

Armour Class Counter - This counter displays your current
Armour Class (AC), based on your character statistics,
traits, and currently worn armour. During combat, this
counter will go up and down. If you have any extra Action
Points at the end of your combat turn, they are
automatically converted to a bonus to your AC. Don’t
panic if your AC constantly changes.
Skilldex Button - Pressing this button will display the
Skilldex window. See page 44.
Map Button - When you press this button, it will open and
display the Automap window for the current map and level.
See page 59 for more information on Automaps.
Character Button - The CHAR button can be pressed to
switch to the Character screen. This is the screen that
shows all of your characters statistics and skills. Very
useful, and should always be used when the display
monitor prints a message that you have gained an
experience level. See page 49 for more information about
the Character screen.
PIPBoy Button - Pressing this button will display the
RobCo PIPBoy 2000, a personal data assistant that will
help record information about your travels. See page 57
for details about this wonderful machine.
Combat Buttons - Outside of combat, this section of the
Interface Bar is covered by a panel. When you are
involved in combat, the panel will slide back to reveal
two combat buttons: END TURN, which will end your current
turn and let the next person or creature have a chance to
act, and END COMBAT, which will attempt to stop all
hostilities. The End Combat button will not work if there
are nearby hostile critters that want to continue doing
bad things to you. Green lights
around the combat buttons mean
that it is your turn. Red lights
mean that someone else is getting
a chance to do bad things.
