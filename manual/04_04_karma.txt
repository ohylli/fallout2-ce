KARMA
============================================================

Karma
These characteristics are earned automatically based on
your actions. All actions have consequences, and your
actions will earn you some type of Karma.
Karma
Karma is the private result of your characters actions.
Kill a good person, and your Karma heads towards the
negative. Kill a bad person or monster, and your Karma
climbs up.
Karma is expressed as a number.
Beginning characters start with a Karma of 0. The only
other way a character can have a Karma of 0 is if they
balance their actions, doing both good and bad in equal
amounts. This is actually hard to do.
If the actions of your character lean towards the
good, the Karma value will rise. Get a positive Karma
high enough, and your character will earn a Karmic title.
The higher your Karma, the better the title.
On the other hand, if your character performs bad
deeds, then your Karma will drop. It can actually go

negative, which means you’ve been a bad boy (or girl.)
The lower it drops, the badder your character is. If the
Karma gets really low, your character can earn a Karmic
title. The worse the Karma, the better the title (if you
like going in that direction.)
Karmic titles can have an affect on your character,
but only after a certain point. It takes a lot for your
character’s inner personality to shine through (or in the
case of bad Karma, ooze through.)
The difference between Karma and Reputation is that no
one has to watch you perform your actions to affect your
Karma. Your character knows, and that’s good enough for
his soul.
Reputation (Town)
If you perform deeds in front of people, you will
eventually earn a Reputation. Most Reputations are based
on a town, since that’s where people live and tend to
watch each other do things.
Like Karma, Reputations are expressed as numbers. The
higher the rep, the better it is. The lower the rep, the
more notorious your character is. 
Many towns will trade with other towns, or eventually
communicate with them, so your character’s reputation in
one town will affect her reputation in other parts of the
wasteland. It may take time, however, and the influence
depends on the link between the two towns.
Reputation will modify what people think of your
character. “Good” non-player characters like good reps.
“Bad” NPCs like bad reps. “Good” NPCs do not like bad
reps. “Bad” NPCs do not like good reps.
Reputation can affect what NPCs think of your
character, bartering deals and the NPCs likelihood of
being hostile.
Reputation (Special)
You can earn special Reputations by performing certain
deeds. These can be good or bad reps. You will see them
appear in the Karma area of the character screen. These
will have some game affect, usually of a serious manner.
