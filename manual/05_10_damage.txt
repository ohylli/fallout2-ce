DAMAGE
============================================================

Damage
Damage is the result of a successful attack in combat.
The more damage you do, the more likely your opponent
will be killed, knocked out, knocked down or just plain
put out of the fight.
Damage can also occur from traps or other non-combat
sources.
Hit Points - Damage removes HP. The amount of damage is
always shown as an amount of HP damage. A critter’s
current HP is equal to their maximum HP minus all the
damage they have taken. When a critter’s HP reaches 0,
that critter is dead. If the player character loses all
of his HP, the game is over.
Critical Hits - Some attacks are just more deadly than
others. The attack may have hit a critical spot, or was
swung with a extra effort, or was just a lucky attack.
These critical hits can cause more damage or have some
other nasty effect on the poor recipient of the hit. The
chance to cause a critical hit is based on the Critical
Chance statistic, if the attack was targeted or not, and
what the difference was between the attacker’s skill and
the final number rolled by the computer.
Some common critical hit effects:
Extra Damage - x1.5, x2 or even x3 points of damage.
Crippled Limb - The attack was so good it disabled a
limb.
Ignore Armour - The attack bypasses armour and
completely affects the target.
Unconsciousness - The attack knocks the target out.
The amount of time the target will remain unconscious is
based on their Endurance. The higher the EN, the quicker
the target recovers.
Knockdown - The target is knocked to the ground. It
will require them to spend a small amount of AP to get

up the next turn.
Instant Death - Some critical hits are just so brutal
the target is instantly slain, usually in a very
spectacular manner.
The type of effect achieved by the critical hit
depends on the target, and the actual location of a
targeted shot.
Critical Failures - It is entirely possible that the
attack was so screwed up, that the attacker did something
really stupid. This is known as a critical failure, and
is usually not a good thing. Critical failures can happen
to the PC, as well as all other critters. Critical
failures happen to the attacker, which can include your
character.
Trying to make a targeted shot with a really low
chance to hit increases the chance that your character
will suffer from a critical failure. The Jinxed trait
means that everyone will suffer from more critical
failures.
The type of critical failure depends on the weapon
used. Characters making unarmed attacks are not immune to
the dread power of critical failures.
Some common critical failure effects:
Running out of ammo - The magazine was damaged, or the
ammo malfunctioned.
Jammed Weapon - Oops! The weapon may jam and require
time to repair.
Loss of AP - The attacker did something stupid, like
brain fart.
Dropped Weapon - The attacker loses grip on his weapon
and it falls to the ground.
Weapon Explodes - This is bad. Only really likely with
explosive or energy weapons.
Hit Unintentional Target - The attacker misses his
original target and hits someone else.

Damage Self - The attacker somehow hurts herself.
There are other critical failure effects. Have fun
finding them out.
Poison - Poison is a nasty type of attack. Poison does
damage over time. Many creatures can do poison damage,
along with their regular HP attacks. Anti-venom can
reduce the effect of poison. The more poison a character
has been affected by, the longer it takes before the
poison is gone, and the more damage the poison while do
on the way out.
See Poison Resistance for more info on poison, page
91.
Radiation - Radiation is an invisible attack. You will
not see the radiation that kills you. Some critters can
cause radiation damage, in addition to their normal
damage. Radiation does not normally leave your system,
either. You must use drugs or other curative processes to
remove radiation. And the more radiation in your system,
the more likely it is to damage you and the worse the
effect.
See Radiation Resistance on page 91 for more about
radiation.
Unconsciousness - This usually occurs from a critical
hit. During this time, the unconscious critter will fall
to the ground and can do nothing until he recovers. The
recovery time is based on Endurance.
Death - There are two ways to die: lose all of your hit
points or be unconscious and the only remaining critters
around you are hostile. We suggest you do neither.
