THE TRIBE

The Tribe
Over time, our ragtag group turned into a tribe. I fell
in love with one of them, and we raised a family, like
all of our tribespeople.
We founded the Village, beyond the great cliff. It is
a secure home thanks to our hard work. We would send
scouts back towards the Vault, to help others who thought
like ourselves, but that slowly came to an end. We no
longer head in that direction. I often wonder what became
of Vault-13, and the other Vaults, but I never had the
time to go exploring again. 

I taught the others the skills they would need to
survive and grow strong. Hunting, farming and other
skills to feed us. Engineering and science to build our
homes. Fighting to protect what was ours.
My love and I led the village and the Tribe. The Tribe
grew, and grew strong with our help. But all things come
to an end. Our sons and daughters are now the leaders.
I’m sure that the Tribe will continue to grow strong
under the leadership of our children.
My love perished years ago, and not a day goes by that
I do not think of Pat’s face. I see it everytime I look
at our children. This journal is our legacy to them, to
their children, and to the rest of the Tribe.
That is my story, and I am sticking to it.
