NPC INTERACTION

NPC Interaction
Non-player characters (NPCs) are the people besides your
character that inhabit the Fallout 2 world. Much of your
time will be spent interacting with them on some level or
another (even if it is with the blade of your dagger, or
a couple rounds of .44), and you must be prepared to do
so.
There are two types of NPCs, those that are party-
members and those that are not. Party-member NPCs are
your friends (or at least they are pretending to be your
friends) or people tagging along with you for a while.
Those that are not, are everyone else in the world.
