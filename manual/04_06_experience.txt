EXPERIENCE
============================================================

Experience
As your character survives, and succeeds at overcoming
the obstacles in his path, he will gain experience
points. When a certain number of experience points are
obtained, your character will increase in level. When
that happens, your character will gain more Hit Points,
more skill points and the occasional Perk.
Experience points can be given to your character for
killing critters in combat, solving problems, and using
skills successfully. The more difficult the critter,
problem or skill use, the more experience points your
character will be awarded with.
It requires more experience points to increase in
level, the higher level your character is. Go up in
levels, and you need even more experience to get to the
next level.
A level is just a generalised measure of how much
experience your character has earned, and how capable
your character is.
The amount of experience required to gain the next
level is shown on your character screen.

Every new level gains your character the following:
Hit Points - Add 3+(1/2 Endurance) to your maximum HP
total.
Skill Points - Gain 5+(2x Intelligence) skill points.
Your character will occasionally gain a Perk, every
three or four levels.
There is no maximum level. You can continue to gain
experience and improve your character, but it takes more
and more experience to increase levels as you play.

Skill Points
Every new experience level will give your character a
number of skill points that you can spend to improve your
character’s skills. It is harder to improve a skill that
is at a higher level. When your character spends skill
points to improve a skill, it will cost more skill points
if the skill is of a higher level.
Tag skills improve faster. They gain +2% instead of
the normal +1%.
The number of skill points your character gains each
level is dependent on their Intelligence (the higher the
Intelligence, the more skill points), and whether or not
your character has the Skilled trait or the Educated
perk.
Spending Skill Points
To spend skill points, simply click on the skill to
highlight it and move the skill point spending bar to
that skill. Press the + or - buttons to increase or
decrease the number of skill points you are spending on
that skill. You cannot decrease the number of skill
points in a particular skill below where it started when
you entered the character screen at this time.
