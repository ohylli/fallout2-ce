INTRODUCTION
The one good thing about growing old is that you get your
way. The new leaders of the Tribe (they refuse to call
themselves Elders until I have passed on, which should be
soon, if I’m lucky) want me to record my knowledge for
future generations. Bah! What knowledge they need is to
be found with sweat and blood, not some letters on a
page. But the future is a great unknown, and they may
have a point. To make them happy, I’ve written down what
I feel will be important. (The important words being
“what I feel will be important.”)
They want me to write my memoirs. Fine. I’ll do it.
But as the song goes, I’ll do it my way. And I’m old
enough that I will get my way.
