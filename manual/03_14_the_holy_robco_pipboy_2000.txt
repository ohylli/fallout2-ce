The Holy RobCo PIPBoy
2000
One of the most holy artifacts
to be found in the Fallout 2
world is the RobCo PIPBoy 2000.
This Personal Information
Processor is highly sought
after since few functioning
units remain. While your
character does not start off with this wonderful device,
one of your first quests will be to retrieve it.
The PIPBoy (as it is commonly called) is a handy
device that you wear on your wrist. It stores information
automatically for you, like a personal secretary, and
also includes a clock and calender function for keeping
track of time.
Use the buttons on the left-hand side of the screen to
select the primary function of the PIPBoy. All other
commands will be entered directly on the screen of the
PIPBoy. You can click on most lines of text to get more
information.
Functions of the PIPBoy 2000
The various functions of the PIPBoy are described below.
Remember that none of these functions are available until
your character finds the PIPBoy.
The Clock and Calender
The upper left-hand corner of the PIPBoy screen shows the
current date and time. The date is shown in
Day:Month:Year format. The time is shown in military
time, a 24-hour clock. When a 24-hour clock is used, an
AM or PM notation is not required. Between 0000 and 1159
are the morning hours, 1200 to 2359 are the evening
hours. 1300 is the same as 1 o’clock in the afternoon.
1800 is 6 o’clock, and so on.
The button between the date and the time is an alarm
clock. Press this button to show a list of timer settings
in the main display. Select one of the timer settings,
and game time will advance quickly. During this time,
your character will rest or sleep. This means that you

will gain more Hit Points than if your character
continued to walk around or fight. Resting is also a good
way of passing the time until the sun rises or sets.
The various timer settings available:
10 minutes
30 minutes
1 hour
2 hours
3 hours
4 hours
5 hours

Until noon (1200 / 12:00PM)
Until evening (1800 / 6:00PM)
Until midnight (0000 / 12:00AM)
Until healed
Use the 10 minute to 6 hour timers if you need to
perform a specific action at a particular time of day.
Some events only occur during the night or during the
day. Some shops are only open during daylight hours, for
example.
The “until” timers are a little more powerful. They
will advanced the clock until the condition is meet. If
you are low on healing items, and you don’t care if you
waste some time, use the “Rest until healed” timer. This
will advance the clock quickly, and it will keep your
character resting until he is restored to full health.
You can monitor the current/maximum number of hit points
on this screen.
While your character is resting, the clock will
advanced quickly. Press ESC to wake up and cancel the
remainder of the timer.

list of the current and former quests. Quests that have
been completed are crossed out. Select a quest to get

more information on it.
The Status function also displays data copied from
holotapes, a kind of recordable media. Select an entry to
display the data. If more than one page of data is
available, use the NEXT and BACK text buttons to move
through the data. To copy data from a holotape, use the
Inventory screen to select the holotape and then use the
Use action icon from the command cursor on it.
