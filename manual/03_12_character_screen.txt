CHARACTER SCREEN
============================================================

Character Screen
Use the character screen to
access all the information
about your character. On this
screen, you can see detailed
information about all of your
character’s statistics, traits,
perks, skills, and karmic
results. You will also use the
character screen to improve
your character when you
increase in experience levels.
You must access the character screen from the
interface bar

This section of the manual explains how the character
screen works. For detailed information about the
characteristics (statistics, skills, traits, perks and
karmic kabobs) found on this screen, refer to the
Character Reference chapter, starting on page 84.
The primary purpose of the character screen is to give
you information about the status of your character: am I
critically hurt? if so, where? poisoned? how many
experience points do I have? when do I go up a level?
how many extra skill points do I have? what are my exact
skill levels? and so on.
The character screen should be accessed as soon as you
get a new experience level.
The character screen in the game is slightly different
than the character screen you might have used if you
created a new character or modified a pre-generated
character. There are a couple of important differences,
most notably, you cannot modify your character’s
statistics, and the select Trait area has been replaced
by Perks, Karma and Kills.
And you cannot change your name. Hopefully, you
selected something other than NONE and it is a name that
you like.
You can click on any text or object of importance on
this screen, and the information card in the lower right-
hand corner will change to display more information about
the statistic, skill, reputation (and so on) that you
selected.
If your character ever gains a new characteristic that
you are not familiar with, use the information card. It
helps.

Basic Info and Statistics
The top of the screen shows your Name, Age and Sex. On
the right side, below that information, are your current
primary statistics.
Immediately below that information is an important
little box that contains your current level, experience
point total, and the experience required to gain the next
level. Since increasing your level will improve your
skills, and occasionally give you access to new abilities
called Perks (see page 101 for more information on those
vital and nifty powers), you should monitor this area
closely. It may be worth it to waste an additional rat
(animal, human or otherwise) in order to get those last
20 points of XP.
Level - Your current experience level. The higher the
better. Increasing your level is some times called
“levelling”, which you can do to entire towns if you are
of high enough level.
EXP - Your current experience point total. You gain
experience from solving problems, completing quests,
using your skills successfully, and of course, killing
Those That Stand In Your Way. The higher your current
level, the more XP it takes to increase levels. (The next
bit of info will show you how much experience you need.)
Next Level - The total amount of experience you need
before you gain a level of experience. If you’ve seen the
movie, “A Bridge Too Far,” you will understand what it is
like to look at this value sometimes.
Hit Points and Medical Information
Your current and maximum hit points will be shown in this
area. Remember, when your current hit points get too low,
you are in danger of dying an early (or just unlucky)
death. Be prepared, keep healing items ready and use your
healing skills as often as possible.
The information under your character’s HP totals is
very important. It shows any critical damage your
character may have taken. In a perfect world, they should
be dull green. In this case, bright is bad. If a line is

in bright green, like the rest of the screen, you have
been inflicted by something horrible and potentially
life-threatening.
Poisoned - This means that you have been poisoned (by
rattle-snakes, giant scorpions from Hell, or Iguana-on-a-
Stick that has gone bad from sitting out in the sun too
long.) Note that this is dangerous, but not necessarily
fatal. Poison does damage over time. The more poison that
you have been infected with, the longer you will take
damage. Fortunately, as the poison starts to wear off, it
takes longer and longer to damage you again.
Radiated - Everyone in the post-nuclear world has some
amount of radiation. Heck, if you live on a tall
mountain, you will absorb some rads every year. And don’t
use those new fangled “Microwaves,” as they can be very
bad for your health. When you start the game, you will
have very little to no measurable radiation. You can
still encounter freak areas of radiation, but you are
more likely to run into radiation-infected creatures that
mean to do you harm. The more accumulated radiation
damage you have, the worse the effect of additional
radiation on your body. Since radiation damage takes a
while to truly affect you, you would be wise to monitor
this characteristic. You can tell exactly how much
radiation you have been exposed to by using a Geiger
counter. Some doctors may be able to treat radiation
damage, and there are two types of drugs that can help.
The following are specific types of damage: crippled
limbs (or crippled eyes) that have a detrimental effect
on your character. They can only be healed with the use
of the Doctor skill. First Aid has no affect on this type
of damage. Generally, you can only get a crippled limb or
eye from a critical hit in combat.
Eye Damage - If your character takes a bad blow to her
eyes or head, she can be crippled in the eyes. Until the
eye damage is healed, your character will have a reduced
Perception. This will affect your character’s ability to
spot things and will affect ranged combat dramatically.
Crippled Right/Left Arm - If your character takes a

serious blow to one of
his arms, it may be
crippled. It could be
the arm, or the wrist,
or the hand that is
seriously hurt. In any
case, if one arm is
crippled, your
character cannot use
two-handed weapons. If
both arms are
crippled, your
character is in a
serious hurt and
cannot use any weapons
at all.
Crippled Right/Left
Leg - A critical hit
to your character’s
leg may cause that leg
to be crippled. If one
leg is crippled, it
will cost more Action
Points (AP) to move.
One crippled leg also
makes it impossible to
run. If both legs are crippled, the AP cost to move is
increased even more. Most characters, with average
amounts of APs, will barely be able to move with two
crippled legs. Naturally, having both legs crippled means
you still cannot run. Non-combat walking speed is not
affected, but this is pretty much a sham to protect your
character from ruffians and other nogood-doers. Get to a
doctor right quick! Well, as quick as your crippled
character can...
If you see
messages in the
display window telling you that
you have been exposed to
radiation, you would be a wise
player to use another savegame
slot until you discover what foul
thing has been done to you.
Radiation damage can permenately
lower your statistics, do HP
damage, or kill you outright.  It all
depends on the amount of
radiation.  Note, that the most
lethal amount of radiation still
takes a small amount of time
before the really bad effects
take affect. Save often, and use
those different slots!
