Targets
One of the first things you need to do is determine
possible targets. You can use the Target Highlight
preference to determine when targets will be highlighted.
We will assume that preference is set to Targeting Only.
When you right-click to change cursor modes, one of
the cursors is the targeting cursor. The targeting cursor
is also available when you click on a weapon in the
active item button area.
All targets within your character’s line of sight*
(LOS) and/or Perception range* will be highlighted. The
colour of the highlight is important.

RED - A critter highlighted red is a possible enemy
within your character’s LOS and Perception range. Proceed
with caution. It’s possible that the critter is neutral,
and wants to have nothing to do with you and your
problems. It’s also possible that the critter could be
planning evil things to do with your character’s corpse.
YELLOW - The critter is out of your character’s LOS, but
within Perception range. It will be impossible for your
character to attack this critter, unless your character
moves closer.
GREEN - This is a friendly critter. Don’t shoot!
NONE - If there is no highlight around a critter, that
particular character or creature is out of our
character’s LOS and Perception range.
* LOS is Line of Sight. This is a straight line between
two characters. If the line is blocked, the characters
are not in LOS of each other. LOS is mutual. By
definition, a character that has LOS to a critter is
within the LOS of the critter. LOS can be blocked by
walls, trees and other large objects.
* Perception range is what your character can hear or
smell, in addition to see. It is possible for your
character to know that a critter is behind a while,
because your character can just perceive them.
