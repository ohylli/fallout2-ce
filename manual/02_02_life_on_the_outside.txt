Life on the Outside
My first few days were harrowing to say the least. I
fought off some giant mutant rats that were more
interested in eating me than they should have been. My
only clue was the location of another Vault, number 15. I
The War.
I know little about the War,
but it doesn’t really matter.
A lot of people died when a
lot of atomic bombs went off
and nearly destroyed the
world.  If you don’t know what
an atomic bomb was, then
imagine the worst thing
possible.  Atomic bombs were
worse than that.
NOTES

spent a couple of days stumbling through the desert
before I came upon a small settlement. I stopped there
for help, and encountered the little town called Shady
Sands. I helped them, and they helped me. Understand that
survival requires that you work together, even with
people you may not trust. I did earn the trust, however,
of two prominent citizens of Shady Sands - Tandy, and her
father, Aradesh.
With their knowledge, and the help of a man called
Ian, I continued on my way to Vault-15. The ruins of
Vault-15, to be more specific. Ravaged by the elements,
scavengers, and time itself, Vault-15 was no help for my
people. The control room that contained their water-chip
was buried under tons of fallen rock, and I had to move
on.
After a small problem with some Raiders, who would
continue for years to plague not only myself, but the
Tribe, I found myself in Junktown. It was here that I
learned the most important rule of all: doing a good
thing sometimes means being a very bad person. My
memories of Junktown are tainted, and I feel no remorse
for my actions in that place. It was there that I came
across a dog, who adopted me and was my faithful friend
from there on. I miss Dogmeat to this day.
While Junktown was a city of traders (and traitors),
it did not have a water-chip. I was not desperate yet, as
there was still time for me to recover the chip and
return to my home, but I needed to move on. Fortunately,
they pointed me in the direction of the Hub, the largest
city in the wasteland.
The Hub was a larger city than both Junktown and Shady
Sands combined. You could drop the Vault in there, and
you probably would not notice. But the people of the Hub
had no life, and it was a desolate place just the same.
It eased my mind, however, to hire some merchants to
bring water to the Vault. Looking back, it was probably a
mistake
to do so, but I was still innocent of the evils that
lurked through the ruins of civilisation.
A small clue led me to the city of the ghouls, the
place they called Necropolis. It was there that I
encountered large mutants, armed with weapons of an
unknown origin. It is with heavy sadness that I say that

Ian lost his life in the city of the dead. A super
mutant burned him to death with a flamethrower. The
passage of time is no proof against the memory of burning
flesh. His sacrifice was not in vain, as I did find the
water-chip buried beneath the city. It was with easier
steps that I returned to Vault-13.
