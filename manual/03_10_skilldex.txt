SKILLDEX
============================================================

Skilldex
Some skills are used
automatically. When you shoot a
gun in combat, the proper gun
skill will automatically be used.
Other skills require that you
actively use them. These skills
are available through the
Skilldex.
Click on the Skilldex button
on the Interface Bar, or use the
Use Skill On action icon to
access the Skilldex.
The Skilldex will display a
list of all the possible skills
that you could use in this situation. Not all skills will
apply, so you must pick the proper skill.
There are a total of eight skills that you can choose
from on the Skilldex. Each skill name is a button. Next
to the button is a counter, showing your current level in
the skill on the adjacent button. As usual, high numbers
are better and show your percentage chance of succeeding
in the use of that skill. The skill level is before
modifiers, so it’s possible to have a really high skill
and still fail.
Click on a skill button to use that skill. All skills,
except for Sneak, will require you to pick a target. If
you accessed the Skilldex through the command cursor with
the Use Skill On action icon, then the target has already
been chosen. If you use the Skilldex button off the
Interface Bar, you will have to choose the target. In
this case, the cursor will change to a targeting cursor.
Move it over the target, and left-click. To not use the
skill after all, right-click or move the cursor over the
Interface Bar.
The Sneak skill does not require a target, since you
can be the only target. Instead, the Sneak skill works
like a toggle. If you are not sneaking, use the Sneak
skill to start sneaking around. If you are sneaking, use
the Sneak skill again to stop sneaking. While you are
using the Sneak skill, a little indicator will appear
just on top of the Interface Bar.
You can also
press the 1 through 8
keys on your keyboard to
access the skills quickly,
without having to resort
to the Skilldex.  This can
save your valuable time,
especially if you are doing
a repetitive action.
