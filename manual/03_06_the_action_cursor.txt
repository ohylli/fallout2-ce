THE ACTION CURSOR
============================================================

The Action Cursor
Fallout 2 uses an
Action Cursor to show
what actions can be
performed at the
current time. There are
four basic modes the
Action Cursor can be in
when you are on the
normal game screen.
Movement (game view
only)
Command
Targeting (turn-based
combat only)
Hand (inventory only)

Normally, the only two cursor types available in the
normal game screen are the Movement and Command cursors.
Targeting is only available when you are in the turn-based
combat mode. The Hand cursor is only available in
Inventory, where it and the Command cursor are available.
Right-click to cycle between the available cursor
types. Outside of combat, right-clicking will toggle
between the Movement and Command cursor. In combat, the
Targeting cursor is available by right-clicking when you
see the Command cursor. Another right-click will cycle
back to the Movement cursor.
A left-click will perform an action that is based on
the cursor type.
See Combat, page 118, for more information on the
Targeting cursor. See Inventory, page 45, for more
information on the Hand cursor.
