MY RETURN TO VAULT-13
============================================================

My Return to Vault-13
I was not treated to a hero’s welcome when I returned to
Vault-13. The overseer met me outside the massive Vault
door, and told me point blank that while my services to
the Vault will always be remembered, he could no longer
trust me or what I had become. He said something along
the lines that I had saved the Vault, and now I must
leave. Bastard.
So, I left.
The days and weeks that followed were hard on me. I
had met few true friends outside the Vault, and they had
died following me. Now, my family had kicked me out and
said that I could never return. I screamed. I cried.
Slowly I came to realise that the Overseer may have been
correct. I had changed. Life outside the Vault was
different, and now I, too, was different. But I have
never forgiven him for doing what he did to me.
I wandered the desert, but never moved far from the
mountains that shielded the Vault from the rest of the
world. Perhaps I wanted to return, and force my way in,
or plead for them to take me back. Fortunately, it did
not come to that. I found a few wretched souls, a small
group of Vault-dwellers, who upon hearing of what
happened to me, had decided to leave the Vault and join
my side. They knew little of the outside world, and would
have died if it were not for my assistance.
Together, our little group moved north, away from the
Vault, and away from that old life. Slowly, I taught them
what experience had taught me. And together we learned to
thrive.
