Probabilities
Attacks in combat are not a sure thing. People are moving
around, trying really hard not to be hit. Armour deflects
blows that otherwise would have done damage.
Weapon attacks will often refer to a “chance to hit.”
You can see this chance when you move the targeting
cursor over a legal target. The number is the percentage
chance, after modifiers, of actually hitting the target.
The higher this number, the more likely you will be able
to hit.
Some examples:
10% chance to hit - You should only be able to hit the
target one out of every ten times.
If you want
to reload and use a
healing item on the same
turn, it is cheaper to
open inventory and do
everything there.  And if
you go to inventory to
use a healing item, you
should remember to reload
any ranged weapons at
the same time.
NOTES

50% chance to hit - You should
hit half the time and miss the
other half.
95% chance to hit - You should
hit 19 out of 20 times, so you
will rarely miss. This, by the
way, is the maximum chance to
hit. Even with super high
skills, and all the modifiers, you have a maximum chance
of 95% to hit.
Your chance to hit is based on the appropriate weapon
skill and it is modified by the range, light level,
armour, cover your target has, and if the attack is
targeted, the specific location you are trying to hit.
For ranged weapons, the distance between your
character and your target is critical. The closer your
character is to the target, the better the chance to hit.
Your Perception is the base factor for how far away a
target can be before it gets harder to hit it. If the
target is really close, you will even have a positive
modifier to your to hit chance.
If your target is in the dark, it will be harder to
see them accurately. Targets that are hard to see are
hard to hit. The light level of the target will modify
your chance to hit. The darker it is, the harder it will
be to hit them.
Armour provides protection by actually deflecting the
attack. Attacks that are deflected, or bounce in the case
of really heavy armour, do no damage. Neat. The negative
modifier to a to hit roll is the Armour Class (AC) of
the armour. See page XX for more details about armour and
how it can help you even if you are hit.
Any obstacle between you and your target is considered
cover. People, barrels, trees are all cover. You cannot
shoot through walls, but it might be possible to shoot
through a window.
See page 130 for details about targeted attacks. The
different locations on the target may be selected. Each
location may have a different modifier to the to hit
chance, but offers the opportunity to increase the amount
of damage done.
