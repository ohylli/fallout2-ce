STARTING COMBAT
============================================================

Starting Combat
There are two ways combat can start. You can initiate it,
or someone else can. You can start combat by left-
clicking on the active item, if it is a weapon, or using
the “A” quick key. NPCs will usually only start combat if
they are hostile, or if you really anger them by doing
something they hate.
Anyway you look at it, once combat starts, you’d
better be prepared to end it.
The person who starts combat gets a free turn, then
all combatants (people participating in the battle) are
ordered in a list by the Sequence statistic. The critter
with the highest Sequence gets to go first, then the
critter with the next best Sequence and so on. Ties are
determine by the best Agility, and if that is still tied,
the best Luck. If it is still tied at that point, the

computer just picks a random critter who is tied for that
position.
Each combatant, starting at the top of the list and
working down, gets a chance to act. When everyone has
gone, it starts all over again at the top of the list.
When combat starts, the
combat buttons in the lower
right-hand side of the interface
bar will be revealed. If the
four lights around the buttons
are bright green, it is your
character’s turn. If the lights
are red, it is a computer characters turn. When it is
your character’s turn, you can act. When it is not, you
must watch the events on screen and wait for the next
turn.
Each turn of combat is five seconds of game time. It
might take longer of actual time to play out that turn.
When it is your turn, you can think about your actions
for as long as you like. There are no time limits here.
