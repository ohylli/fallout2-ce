THE VATS

The Vats
My job was still not finished, for I still had one task
remaining. The Master had literally built his army one
mutant at a time. Humans, preferably with little
radiation damage, were to be captured and sent to the
Vats. There they were dipped in something called FEV,
which transformed them into the large, grotesque mutants.
I had to find these Vats, and put them out of action
as well, lest another take the Masters place and continue
to build the mutant army. Fortunately, my friends at the
Brotherhood had a few clues, and helped me reach my goal.
Invading the Vats, I came across more mutants and
robots. None could stand in my way. I had a mission. I
had a goal. I had a really large gun. It was here that
Dogmeat fell, a victim of a powerful energy forcefield. I
miss that dog.
I destroyed the Vats that day, and with it, the mutant
army. The last I heard, they splintered and disappeared
into the desert.
