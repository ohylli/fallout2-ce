PARTY MEMBERS
============================================================

Party Members
It is possible to have other people join your character.
You may have to talk them into it, solve a quest, pay
them money or otherwise convince them that your character
needs their services. Non-player characters that want to
join your character’s party are few in number.
The benefits of additional party members are many.
They will assist you in combat, to some degree or
another, and they will lend their experience and skills
to yours. They can help you carry more equipment. They
can offer their wisdom by giving you information and
advice.
And they are another target, meaning that combat will
be a tiny little bit safer for your character.
You have limited control over party members, however.
You cannot control them directly in combat. You can give
them orders before combat starts, but once the battle is
on, they are their own person.
Using the Talk action icon on a party member will give
you access to the two parts you
do have control over: their
inventory and their basic
combat strategies.

NOTES

dialogue screen. Notice that the BARTER button has been
replaced with the TRADE button. Press the Trade button
and the trading interface will slide up over the lower
portion of the screen.
Trading is similar to Barter (see page 68), but it has
several important differences. First, the values at the
bottom of the trading table show the total inventory
weight of the characters involved.
Second, and most importantly, trades do not have to be
equal when you are trading with party members. Since your
character is the leader of the party, you have complete
control over who gets what.
Drag items from your inventory to the table to give
them to the NPC. Move items from the NPCs inventory list
to the table if you want them. Press the TRADE button
when you are done moving items. Press the TALK button to
cancel the current trade.
Party Member Combat
Control
Also on the extended dialogue
screen of a party member is the
COMBAT CONTROL button. Pressing
it will slide the combat
control interface over the
lower portion of the screen.
This panel shows some basic
information about this NPC. You can also select many of
the buttons to adjust the way the NPC acts. You can
adjust the actions of the NPC at anytime except the
middle of combat.

This information is not adjustable:
HP - Shows the current and maximum Hit Points of the NPC.
Skill - This is the best non-combat skill that the NPC
knows.
Carrying - The current and maximum weight that this NPC
can carry.
Melee Dam - The current Melee Damage bonus for this NPC.
APs - How many Action Points this NPC has.
You can press the following buttons:
Use Best Weapon - This will force the NPC to stop using
their current weapon and use the best weapon in their
inventory. The choice of the best weapon depends on the
Weapon Preference of the NPC, something that is part of
their Disposition (see below.) Unlike the player
character, NPCs cannot use all weapon types. Individual
NPCs will be trained in the use of different weapons. The
newly selected weapon will be displayed.
Use Best Armour - This will force the NPC to stop wearing
their current armour and use the best armour in their
inventory (which could be the armour they are currently
wearing.) Unlike the player character, their image will
not change when they wear new armour. Trust us, they are
wearing the new duds, but you just can’t see it. The
display will show what armour the NPC is wearing and they
will get the benefit of the armour’s Armour Class, Damage
Threshold and Damage Resistance.
Disposition - This controls the way the party member acts
in combat. Some NPCs do not allow particular dispositions
to be set. If a really butch combat guy joins your party,
he may just say no if you try and set him to the Coward
disposition. Press one of the following to attempt to set
the NPC to that disposition:
Berserk
Aggressive
Defensive
Coward

Custom
Each of the first four dispositions are preset. The
fifth disposition, Custom, allows you, the player, to
individually set the components that
make up a disposition. And if you are asking just exactly
what those components are, here you go:
Burst - This controls how often the party member uses the
selector switch on any burst-capable weapon they are
using. Basically, this controls whether or not the NPC
will shoot more than one round at a time, if they have a
weapon that is capable of burst fire. Possible choices,
in descending order of likelihood:
Always
Sometimes, don’t worry about hitting me.
Be careful not to hit me.
Be sure you won’t hit me.
Be absolutely sure you won’t hit me.
Run Away - This determines when the party member will
decide to flee from combat. It is based on the percentage
of HP remaining. The less hit points remaining, the more
likely it is for the NPC to stop attacking and start
looking for a back door to run out or a bush to hide
under. Possible choices, in descending order of
likelihood:
Abject Coward
Your finger hurts.
You’re bleeding a bit.
Not feeling good.
You need a tourniquet.
Never!
Weapon Preference - This determines what kind of weapon
the party member prefers to use. If you select Melee
(only), Ranged (only) or Unarmed, then the party member
will not attack if they cannot use their listed
preference. Possible choices:
Melee
Melee then Ranged
Ranged then Melee

Ranged
Unarmed
Distance - This controls how the party member moves
around in combat. Some of these will not be available or
work properly, depending on the weapon preference.
Possible choices:
Stay close to me.
Charge!
Snipe the enemy.
On your own.
Stay where you are.
Attack Who - This preference controls who the NPC will
decide to attack, if they have a choice. Possible
choices:
Whomever is attacking me.
The Strongest.
The Weakest.
Whomever you want.
Whomever is closest.
Chem Use - This final setting controls how often the NPC
will use chems. Two of these settings allow the use of
any chem, while the two Stimpak settings only allow the
use of Stimpaks. NPCs can only use chems that they have
in their inventory, so you will have ultimate control
over what they can and can’t use. Possible choices:
I’m clean.
Stimpaks when hurt a bit.
Stimpaks when hurt a lot.
Any chem some of the time.
Any chem, any time.
