APPENDIX 1:
Tutorial
This section will give you a brief tutorial on game
functions and give you a head start at the beginning of
the game. This tutorial assumes that you have already
installed Fallout 2 and doubled-click on the Fallout 2
icon or ran it from the Win95 Start menu.
Start a new game by selecting NEW GAME from the main
menu. For now, click on the TAKE button to select Narg, a
combat-based character that is the easiest character to
start the game with.
After the tribal elder tells you of your mission, you
will appear standing in front of the temple of trials.
Narg, your character, is standing on the steps in the
centre of the screen. Press F1 if you need a quick
reminder of the basic functions and icons on this screen.
Equip Narg with a weapon, since Narg likes to kick a
little bootie every now and then. Click on the INV button
on the interface bar to open Narg’s bag of goodies. Narg
is pretty poor and only has a spear. That’ll have to do
for now. Move the cursor over the spear. Right-click once
to change the cursor mode. Left-click on the spear to
examine it a little more closely. Then right-click again
to change the cursor back to the hand. Left-click on the
spear and hold the mouse button this time. Notice that
the cursor becomes the spear. The cursor is one with the
spear. Drag the spear to the ITEM1 slot and release the
left-mouse button. Narg is now wielding the spear. Click
on the DONE button to return to the game.
Move the cursor to the corners of the screen. The
screen will scroll to show you more of the map. This map
is pretty small. About the only things of
interest on this map are the actual entrance to the
temple and that guy standing to the south of you.
Go talk to that guy. Right-click to change cursor
modes and left-click on the guy, er, guard. Narg will run
up to him and start a conversation. See page 63 for full
information about talking to non-player characters. For
now, click on the “Just thought I’d say hello...” line
and say good-bye to the man. If you move the cursor over
the NPC for a moment, you will see a brief description of

him in the display monitor.
Left-click to change back to the movement cursor and
click in the dark entrance area of the temple.
Good thing you pulled out that spear. There is a
(somewhat) dangerous animal hiding in the darkness of the
temple. Move Narg in the direction of the scorpion. Don’t
move too close. Wait for the scorpion to notice you and
start combat.
The scorpion should move right up to Narg. Convenient
for Narg, bad for the scorpion. Left-click on the spear
button on the interface bar. The cursor will change to a
targeting attack cursor and the scorpion will highlight.
Left-click on the scorpion to attack it. If you miss,
click the END TURN button. If you hit and don’t kill the
scorpion, left-click to change cursor modes and walk away
from the scorpion. If you kill it, click the END COMBAT
button.
Change the cursor to the action cursor (right-click
until the cursor is an arrow) and left-click on the large
door. This type action uses the item in question. In the
case of doors, this action attempts to open them.
Walk north and take the first corridor on your right.
Kill any scorpions that you come across. As a shortcut,
you can right-click in combat to select the targeting
cursor. Keep moving away from the monsters, as it makes
them work harder to attack you. Narg only gets one attack
with his spear each turn.
Continue on to the end of this corridor, until you
come to a small room. Use the Pot in the north end of
the room. Drag the bag of healing powder from the pot to
Narg’s inventory or use the TAKE ALL button. Click on the
DONE button you are finished looting the pot. Then leave
this room and continue back to the main corridor and
continue to explore this level until you come to another
set of large doors to the north.
(If you want to move faster, hold down SHIFT while
clicking to move. This will make your character run
instead of walk.)
Notice this door is locked. You will need to pick the
lock. Click on the SKILLDEX button and select LOCKPICK.
The cursor will change to a yellow targeting cursor.
Left-click on the door to attempt to pick the lock.
Continue using the SKILLDEX button until you pick the

lock.
Then use the door to open it and proceed north.
This next corridor is trapped where it widens and
opens up. Proceed slowly through the area. If Narg sees a
raised plate, it indicates that a trap trigger has been
found. Walk slowly to the west side of the corridor and
then walk carefully to the north. Avoid stepping on any
trap triggers.
If Narg gets hurt, either by the scorpions or the
traps, open Inventory and use the healing powder. To do
so, right-click to change cursor modes to the Inventory
action cursor. Left-click and hold on the healing powder.
A column of icons will appear. While holding the mouse
button, move the mouse down to select the upraised hand
(the Use icon) and release the mouse button. Narg will
munch on the powder and feel much better.
From here, you should continue to have Narg explore
the temple. Keep proceeding, killing hostile animals as
you come across them and using your skills and wits to
bypass other obstacles.
Good luck!
