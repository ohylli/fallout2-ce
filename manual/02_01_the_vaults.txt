THE VAULTS

The Vaults
Like all of the original
members of the Tribe, I came
from the Vaults. Before the
War, the government of the
United States, which numbered
in the thousands of villages,
and had many, many tribesman
per village, paid to have
these huge holes dug in
mountains and huts of metal
and stone built underground.
There were many Vaults. Some
were close to cities, and
some far away. These Vaults
were to be used as safe
places in case of atomic war.
As you may guess, when the War came your ancestors made
it to a Vault. Vault-13 to be specific.
For several generations, your ancestors and mine lived
within the Vault. As best as they could figure, it was
too dangerous to try and leave the Vault. They grew their
own food, recycled their waste, read, worked, slept, had
families, and even purified the necessary water within
the Vault. I was born in the creche, and was raised by
the community (and a robot). It was a good life, but all
good things come to an end. About three generations after
the War, the water-purification chip the Vault relied on
to create the fresh water broke down. All the spare parts
were missing or busted, and without the water-chip the
Vault was doomed. Something had to be done.
The Overseer gathered the healthy of us between a
certain age and made us draw straws. Guess what? I drew
the short one. Wouldn’t be much of story if I didn’t,
would it?
I left the Vault the next day.
