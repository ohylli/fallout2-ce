============================================================

Options
Options allow you to save your game, load a
previously saved game, change the
preferences, or exit the game and return
to the main menu. The various options are
accessed by pressing the options button
(the Big “O”) on the interface bar.
When you press the options button on
the interface bar, this small window with
five different options will appear. Press one of these
buttons to access that option. Save Game, Load Game, and
Preferences are all complex enough that they need their
own sections (see below.) The other two buttons are
pretty straight-forward and are briefly explained here:
Exit - This returns you the main menu. Since it does not
automatically save your game, another window will appear
asking you to confirm this action.
Done - Closes the options window and returns to the game.
Save Game
When you want to stop playing,
or if you want to save your
progress so if something Really
Bad happens you don’t have to
start over from the very
beginning, then you want to use
this option. Saving your game
often is a good idea, especially
if you are in a dangerous area
or if you get a bad feeling about what is just around
the corner.
There are ten save game slots. A save game slot will
hold one save game file, so you can save up to ten
different locations or positions at a time.
Once you save ten save games, you will have to select
one of the older games to overwrite when you decide to
save a new game.
When you first start playing Fallout 2, all ten slots
will be empty. Each slot will say EMPTY, just to prove
IffAD fiflnE
EXIT GAME

our point.
To see what a save game
slot contains, left-click
once on a slot. A picture of
where you saved the game will
appear, along with a small
text description showing the name, game date, and time of
the saved location.
To save a game, double-left-click on a slot, or select
the slot and press the DONE button. Type a description
that makes sense to you. Press ENTER on your keyboard, or
press the DONE button. If you chance you mind, and do not
want to use this slot, press CANCEL.
The game will be saved, and you will get a message
informing you if the everything went well. The most
common problem when saving is if you run out of free hard
disk space. The longer you play, the larger the save game
file will get.
Load Game
When it comes time to return to
a previously saved game, then
you will want to use this
screen. This is also the same
screen available from the main
menu.
The load game screen is very
similar to the save game
screen.
The list of the ten save game slots is displayed on
the left-hand side of the screen. A small picture of the
currently selected save game is displayed on the upper
right-hand side. A description of that same save game is
just below the picture.
To load a game, double-left-click on the appropriate
slot or left-click once on the slot to select it and then
press the DONE button.
If you do not want to load a game, press the CANCEL
button.
CANCEL

Preferences
These preferences control
aspects of the game. All the
preferences here can be
adjusted by you, the player. In
this way, you are given a
chance to modify the game to
your liking.
All of the preferences below
have two or more settings. One of the settings will be
the default setting, which is set back at the Fallout
factory by well-trained professionals. Don’t worry,
however, they won’t get upset if you decide to deviate
from the norm and change the default setting.
There is a philosophy about saving
games.  Some people say that you should only have one
savegame file, and you should rarely save to it.  These
people believe that this increases the danger of playing
the game, and is thus more dramatic.  Others claim that you
should be able to save before every combat, be able to
replay every action and have unlimited saves.  Since the
Fallout 2 development team is pretty nice, we tend to lean
towards the latter.  You are allowed to save up to 10 save
games, using slots, at pretty much anytime.  Should you
save every few steps?  Well, it’s up to you.  We do highly
suggest that you use multiple slots when you save.  Start
with slot 1, and then use slot 2, then slot 3 and so on.  Only
use slot 1 again when you have gone through all ten slots.
This way, if something really bad happens to your
character or savegame, you have a fairly recent backup of
the game and you won’t lose much progress.  But the
frequency of your game saving, and how you use it to play
the game, is entirely in your hands.
NOTES

The options are listed in the brackets following the
name of the preference. The underlined option is the
factory-set default option.
Game Difficulty [Easy, Normal, Hard]
This preference controls the overall difficulty of
reaction and other non-combat related rolls. Negative
reaction modifiers are halved, and all non-combat rolls
are made with a +20% bonus if set to Easy. If set to
Hard, all negative reaction rolls are increased by 25%,
and all non-combat skills are reduced by 10%.
You can adjust this preference at anytime during the
game. There is no penalty or reward for using any of the
settings.
Combat Difficulty [Wimpy, Normal, Rough]
Controls the difficulty of combat. On Wimpy level, all
opponents have a negative modifier to hit you, do less
damage and take fewer targeted shots. On the Rough
setting, they will hit you more often, do more damage and
tend to take more targeted shots.There is no penalty or
reward for using any of the settings, and you can change
this preference whenever you wish.
Combat Speed [Slider: [Normal -> Fastest, Player
Checkbox]
This slider controls how fast the non-player
characters move and attack during combat (actually, just
how fast they animate -- they still get their normal
amount of attacks, but it just looks like they are moving
quickly.)
If the Player checkbox is clicked on, then the player
will also be animated quickly.
If combat is moving a little too slow for you, move
the slider to the right until combat is humming along at
the speed you like.
Combat Taunts [On, Off]
This preference turns the combat taunt messages on and
off. If you get tired of the little quotes that non-
player characters say during combat, then turn this
preference off.
The player character never says a combat taunt.

Combat Messages [Verbose, Brief]
When set to Verbose, combat messages will be more
detailed with “flavour” text. If set to Brief, the
messages will contain the same information but they will
be shorter, since they only contain the critical stuff.
Target Highlight [On, Off, Targeting Only]
When set to On, this preference will always highlight
characters during combat. When set to Off, you will never
get a highlight. When set to Targeting Only, the
highlights will only appear when you are actually using a
targeting cursor in combat.
The colour of the highlight will give you detailed
information about the character. See page 116 in the
Combat section for more details.
Violence Level [None, Minimal, Normal, Maximum Blood]
This preference controls what happens when a character
is killed in the game. On Maximum Blood, you will see the
most violent, gruesome deaths possible. Normal shows most
of the deaths, but doesn’t show a couple of the really
bloody ones. Minimal shows characters falling over in a
pool of blood. None just shows the characters falling
over.
Since there is no practical difference in the game
(except that it is a little more difficult to tell dead
characters from unconscious characters with the None
setting), you can set it to whatever setting you like.
Notice that Maximum Blood is the default setting, and
Normal is not. That should be a scary indicator of what
the development team considers normal...
Text Delay [Slider: Slow -> Normal -> Faster]
This preference controls how long floating text and
dialogue screen messages are displayed. Slow speed text
messages are displayed for twice as long
as normal. Faster speed messages are only displayed for
half the normal amount of time.

Language Filter [On, Off]
There is some naughty language in Fallout 2. When the
Language Filter is used, this text will appear as “&^!@!”
instead of the more normal “!@&^@%!”. Hmm. This manual is
using a language filter. The setting of this preference
is left to the user.
Running [Normal, Always]
If set to Always, your character will run instead of
walk when you left-click with the movement cursor, and
you must shift-click to make the character walk. Normal
is the default setting, where left-click is walk and
shift-click is run.
A note to our younger players:
If you are under the age of 17, you should look at
the little black rating on the box to this game.  It says
Mature.  We mean it.  There are some really adult
situations that occur in this game.  There are couple
of preferences that you can set to make it more likely
that your parents will not kick you out of the house if
they discover you playing this game.  Click the Language
Filter to On, and click the Violence Level to Normal or
Minimal.
A note to parents: If you discover your child playing
this game with all the settings set to their normal
Mature levels, we don’t actually suggest that you kick
your kid out of the house.  That would be really rude.
NOTES

Master Audio Volume
[Slider: Off -> Quiet -> Normal -> Loud]
This preference controls the overall volume of the
audio. If set to Off, it overrides all other audio
preferences. The Music, Sound Effects and Speech volume
controls will all adjust their volume based on the master
audio volume control.
Music/Movie Volume
[Slider: Off ->>Quiet -> Normal -> Loud]
This slider controls the volume of the music and the
audio during the cinematic movie sequences.
Sound Effects Volume
[Slider: Off -> Quiet -> Normal ->>Loud]
This slider controls the volume of the sound effects.
Speech Volume
[Slider: Off -> Quiet -> Normal -> Loud]
Controls the volume of the digitised speech some
characters use.

Brightness Level
[Slider: Normal -> Brighter]
This preference controls the how bright the graphics
are on your screen. For some computers, video cards and
monitors, you may need to turn the brightness level up a
notch or two to see the darker screens better.
Mouse Sensitivity [Slider: Normal -> Faster]
This slider controls how fast the mouse cursor moves.
The higher the setting, the faster the mouse.
Item Highlight [Off, On]
If set to On, when you move the command cursor over an
item on the ground, that item will be highlighted. If set
to Off, you will have more difficulty finding items on
the ground.
Subtitles [Off, On]
This preference controls any subtitles during
cinematic movie sequences. If set to On, you will see
text displayed at the bottom of the movie.
