INVENTORY
============================================================

Inventory
If you press the INV button on
the interface bar, it will cost
four AP to open inventory. If
you do not have the four AP,
you cannot open inventory.
Once you open inventory,
however, you can perform as
many actions in there as you
want. If you do nothing at
all, it still costs the four
AP. If you attempt to open
inventory again on the same
turn, it will cost an
additional four AP.
Other Actions
If you perform actions that require a reasonable amount
of work and time, like opening a door, it will cost three
AP. Some skills or actions require so much game time that
they cannot be used in a combat turn. Specifically, First
Aid and Doctor skills cannot be used in combat.
Some interface issues require no time at all in the
larger scheme of things. Right-clicking on the active
item button to change weapon modes requires no APs.
Neither does switching between the two active item slots.
