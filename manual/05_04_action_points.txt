ACTION POINTS
============================================================

Action Points
The number of actions you can take each turn are
determined by a character’s total number of Action Points
(AP), the more APs your character has, the more things
she can do.
You will spend your character’s APs when you perform
an action, when you are out of APs your turn is over.
Fortunately, you get all of your APs back at the start of
the next turn.

The number of action points your character has is
located over the active item button on the interface bar.
The AP lights only show the first ten AP your character
has. If your character has more than 10 AP remaining,
those action points will not be shown. When you spend
enough APs so that less than ten are remaining, the
number of lights representing APs will start to wink off.
Different actions cost different amounts of APs. It
costs very little to walk one hex (one AP to be
specific), but it costs more to walk several hexes.
Attacking with a knife is faster than aiming with a
rifle, so the knife attack will cost less AP to perform.
Actions in Combat
The following chart will give you an idea of the number
of APs required to perform an action. The actual amount
may vary, depending on your character and what item your
character uses.

Movement
The AP cost to move is shown in the middle of the
movement cursor when you pause the cursor for a moment
over the destination hex. If there is a red X in the
centre of the cursor, then you do not have enough AP to
move that far, or there is something (or someone)
blocking your access to that hex.

Running in combat has no bonus or penalty.
You can reserve enough AP to move and still use your
active item by holding down the CTRL key while clicking
to move. If you want enough AP left over to shoot your
target, but you want to get as close as possible to the
target in order to reduce the range penalty to a minimum,
use reserve movement. Example: Your character has nine AP
remaining. Your current weapon is a Colt 6520. It costs
five AP to shoot that weapon in non-targeted mode. If you
hold down CTRL while clicking on a hex that is eight
hexes away, you will only move (9-5) four hexes towards
the destination hex. You will still have five AP
remaining, just enough to shoot the pistol.
Attacking
The number of AP required to make an attack depends on
the type of weapon used (if any) and the type of attack.
Weapons that are big and bulky will require more AP to
use than smaller weapons. The AP cost for the attack is
always shown in the lower left-hand corner of the active
item button.
All ranged weapon attacks are assumed to be aimed.
Ammunition is scarce. Every shot must count.
Targeted shots are aimed shots that your character
spends more time performing. Targeted shots require an
additional AP to perform.
To attack, right-click on the active item button
(which should contain a weapon or be empty, if you want
to use Unarmed attacks) until the button is displaying
the attack mode you want to use. Left-click on the button
to get a targeting cursor. Move the targeting cursor over
the target and left-click again to attack.
You can continue to attack in a turn until you run out
of APs to pay for an attack. It is possible to use two
different types of attacks, as well.
