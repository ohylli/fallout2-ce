MELEE WEAPONS & HTH COMBAT
============================================================

Melee Weapons & HtH Combat
The use of melee weapons and unarmed combat is
collectively known as Hand to Hand combat (HtH). This
sort of combat occurs at very close ranges. Most of the
time the two opponents will be adjacent, at a range of
one hex. Some melee weapons can attack an opponent that
is two hexes away. Anything beyond that, you need a
ranged weapon. This type of combat can be very deadly,
since most attacks are faster and the chance for a
critical hit is increased.
HtH combat has a major disadvantage: if you can hit
your opponent, he can hit you. With ranged weapons, you
can fire from a distance, and if your opponent is not
similarly armed, you can plink at them as they approach.
The good thing about HtH combat: less ammunition is
used, and the attacks are generally a little faster to
perform, letting your character take additional actions.

SWING & THRUST - These are
attack types common to melee
weapons. Melee weapons have a
base amount of damage, plus they
get a bonus from Strength (the
Melee Damage statistic.)
Many melee weapons can make a targeted attack. This
attack costs an additional AP to perform, but is more
likely to cause damage. See page 130 for targeted
attacks.
RELOAD - Some melee weapons require power cells, a type
of ammo. If the power level gets low in the weapon, use
this option to recharge the weapons battery.
PUNCH - If ITEM1 is empty in
inventory, you can make punch
attacks. The better your unarmed
skill, and other
characteristics, the more damage
your
punches will do. Basic punch damage is based off of your
character’s Melee Damage stat. Characters that work on
improving their Unarmed skill will learn how to throw
more and more powerful punches. Some punches require
other characteristics as well.
See the Unarmed skill description starting on page 89
for more information.
KICK - ITEM2 in inventory must
be empty so you can make kick
attacks. Kicks do more damage,
but require more AP. Kick damage
is modified by Melee Damage.
Characters that specialise in
Unarmed can do better and better kicks as they learn
more. Other characteristics are required to learn this
more advanced kicks.
See the Unarmed skill description starting on page 91
