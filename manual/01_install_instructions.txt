install Fallout 2 on your computer and do a very simple
setup procedure.

kit:
* Fallout 2 Game CD-ROM

WIN95/98/NT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
If you have Win95/98/NT installed on your computer, you
should install the Win95 version of Fallout 2. DirectX
must be installed prior to running SETUP.
To install the Win95/98/NT version of Fallout 2,
follow these steps:
(1) Insert the Fallout 2 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM
drive.

(2) If you have Autoplay enabled, then you will
shortly see an Autoplay menu. Click on the Install
button.
(3) If you do not have Autoplay enabled, open the CD-
ROM and double-click on the SETUP icon.
(4) If necessary, you will need to install DirectX
3.0a or higher. You can install it from the
Autoplay menu, or run DXSETUP.EXE from the DirectX
directory on the CD-ROM.
To Uninstall, go to the Control Panel -> Add/Remove
Programs, select FALLOUT 2 and click on the Add/Remove
button. The uninstaller only removes the files installed
by the installer. Any files created after install (config
files, save games, etc.) must be removed by hand.
README FILE
The README.TXT file on the CD contains up to date
information that was not available when the manual went
to press. We suggest you view the README to get the
latest information and changes. You can do this from the
Win95/98/NT Autoplay menu by clicking on the View Readme
button.
