SKILLS
============================================================

Skills
All of your character’s skills and their current level
are displayed here. Your character’s current skill point
total, gained from experience levels, will be displayed
on the Skill Point counter. You can spend these skill
points to improve your skills, or you can save them for
use at a later time. Since it costs more skill points to
improve a skill as it increases in skill level, it makes
sense to store a small number of skill points. Just
remember that every skill point you store is one that you
could be using!
To spend skill points, simply click on the skill to
highlight it and move the skill point spending bar to
that skill. Press the + or - buttons to increase or
decrease the number of skill points you are spending on
that skill. You cannot decrease the number of skill
points in a particular skill below where it started when
you entered the character screen at this time.
See page 115 for information about Experience Points,
Levels and new skill points.
Perks, Karma & Kills
This section of the screen contains three different
displays. Click on a tab to switch to that display. You
can choose from:
Perks - This display shows your character’s current
Perks, or special abilities that you gain every few
levels. For most normal characters, every three levels
you will have the ability to choose from a list of Perks.
Characters that have the Skilled trait must advance four
levels before they can choose a new Perk. Each Perk will
appear as a separate entry. If you selected the Perk
multiple times to increase the ability of the Perk, that
rank will appear as a number next to the Perk name. Click
on a Perk to view the information card about it.
Use the arrow buttons to scroll the list up or down if
you have too many Perks to view on one screen at the
same time.
At the bottom of this display, you will see your
chosen traits.

Karma - As the player, you will make choices for your
character and those choices will have ramifications. The
results of your choices will be found on this display.
For good or bad, your actions will change your character.
This display basically shows three types of information:
Karma score, town reputations and special reputations.
Your charcter’s Karma score is kind of a one-shot
indicator of the results of all the actions you have
taken up to now. A positive number means that you have
basically acted as a good guy. A negative number means
that you have been the bad guy. Imagine it as a scale.
Every good deed and bad deed that you do, regardless if
it is noticed by the outside world, is recorded. Bad
deeds will lower your Karma, while good deeds will raise
your Karma. A Karma that hovers around zero means that
you are basically neutral, or you are like a newborn
child -- you haven’t had a chance to prove yourself one
way or the other.
Reputation is also a measure of your deeds, but only
if other people witness your actions. Each location will
think of you differently, but some locations can hear
about your deeds from one town or the other, and will
thusly be modified by your reputation in other towns. A
positive reputation is good, a negative one is bad and
one that is close to zero is neutral. It is possible to
have a really good reputation in a town, and have a
really low Karma (in this case, you are a stinker and no
one knows about you, yet.) It is also possible to have a
poor rep and good Karma (you do good things, but no one
has noticed.)
Your character can earn Special Reputations for doing
actions that are really spectacular, either good or bad.
Special Reputations will modify what people think of you,
and can give you additional positive or negative
modifiers.
Kills - This display simply shows the number of critters
(including humans) that you have slain in battle, by
critter type. If you kill a bunch of rats, for example,
you can refer to this card to see just how many rats you
have killed since you started Fallout 2. While this does
serve no real purpose, since you gain experience points
for each kill and that is recorded in a different

location, it does serve as an excellent tool for bragging
rights.
Information Card
This card will update to show you more detailed
information about the currently selected statistic,
skill, perk, trait, karmic bobble, or anything else that
is selectable on the character screen.
It also has a cute picture depicting the chosen
characteristic in action. Sometimes, cute is not the
proper word to be used.
Print, Cancel and Done
The following options are available at the bottom of the
character screen.
Print - Pressing this button will save the current record
of your character as a text file on your own computer.
Show it to your friends, or post it on the Internet. When
you press this button, a window will appear. Type the
name of the text file in this window. When you hit the
ENTER key on your keyboard, the text file will be saved.
If you want, you can then copy this text file to your
printer, or open it with a text editor and print it out
from there.
Cancel - Returns to the game. All changes that you have
made to this character since you entered this screen will
be lost. If you spend some skill points, or if you
purchase a Perk that you later regret, press this button
and, with a wave of a magic wand, everything will be as
it was!
Done - Accepts any changes that you have made and returns
you to the game. The typical way of exiting the character
screen.
