Matters of Life and Death
As you explore the post-nuclear world, you will
eventually come into conflict with other characters or
creatures. Sometimes you can solve these problems with
diplomacy or stealth, depending on what your character is
good at. Sometimes it is going to come down to who has
the bigger gun.
And who can use it better...
Combat in Fallout 2 is turn-based. While the rest of
the game is “real-time,” meaning that while you are
moving other characters may move as well, a turn-based
game is different. The way it works is that your
character gets a chance to act, then the next person does
all of his actions, and then the next person and so on.
When everyone has had a chance to act, the turn is over
and the whole thing starts over again at the top.
When everyone else is dead or they have fled, the
combat is over and the game reverts back to real-time. If
your character dies, then the game is over.
This chapter on combat will often refer to hexes. A
hex is short for hexagon, or a six-sided polygon. Hexes
are a way of managing distance and movement. Each hex is
one meter. A target ten hexes away is ten meters away, or
roughly thirty feet.
