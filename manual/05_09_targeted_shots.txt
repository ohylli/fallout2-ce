TARGETED SHOTS
============================================================

Targeted Shots
Most attacks are done just
trying to hit the opponent. But
if the character takes a little
more time, it is possible to
make a more difficult attack
that can do more damage. These
are known as targeted attacks.
Not all attacks can be targeted. Burst and explosive
weapons cannot make targeted attacks. Characters that
have the Fast Shot trait will never even see the targeted
shot icon.
Right-click on a weapon in the active item button
until a small targeting icon appears in the lower right-
hand corner of the button. Left-click on the button to
select the targeting cursor. The colour is red to remind
you that this is a targeted shot. Left-click on the
target.
A window will appear showing a wireframe of the target
and all the specific locations
you can target.
You can attack one of eight
different locations. Each
location, like an arm or leg,
is easier or harder to hit.
Your adjusted to hit chance is
shown next to the location
name. A to hit chance of “--”
means your character has no chance of success, the attack
is just too difficult for a character of that skill.
Click on a location name to attempt the attack. Press the
CANCEL button if you decide the targeted attack is not
worth it. A normal attack always goes for the torso.
Targeted attacks have a higher chance of scoring a
critical hit. The more difficult the location was to hit,
the higher the chance of actually doing a critical hit.
The type of critical hit that is achieved is also based
on the location of the targeted hit. Hitting a person in
the head can do more damage than hitting them in the left
leg.
