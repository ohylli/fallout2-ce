INVENTORY
============================================================

Inventory
The Inventory screen is used to keep track and use items
that you come across during the course of your adventure.
It also allows you to equip your character with items or
weapons. You are limited in the number of items that you
can carry. Every item has a specific weight. The maximum
number of items you can carry is based on your Carry
Weight statistic. You can Examine an item to determine
the items weight.
Cursors
There are two cursors that you
can use on this screen: The
Hand cursor and the Command
cursor. Right-click to switch
between them.
The hand cursor will allow
you to pick up and move items
around. With the hand cursor
visible, move it over an item,
left-click and hold the mouse
button down. Move the cursor around. Release the left
mouse button to drop the item into its new location. If
you are moving more than one item, a special window will
appear and ask you how many of the items do you wish to
move.
If you move completely identical items on to each
other, they will “stack.” Stacked items show only one
picture, but the number of items in the stack will
appear. This is more convenient than having many items
take up space in your inventory list. In the case of
ammunition, it will show the total number of rounds in
all of the magazines in this stack. When you move ammo,
you move it by magazine, not individual rounds. Guns must
have the exact number of rounds remaining, and the ammo
must be of the exact same type. Stacking guns that are
not unloaded is rare.

Moving or Dropping Multiple Items
The picture shows the items being moved. The counter
shows the current number of items being moved. Press the
+ and - buttons to increase or decrease the number of
items being moved. You can also
type the number of items, up to
99999, on your keyboard. If you
are moving a bunch of items,
type the number instead of
using the +/- buttons.
If you want to move all the
items, press the ALL button.
If you are happy with the
number of items being moved, press DONE.
If you decided not to move any items at all, press
CANCEL.
If you use the Drop Item action icon on a stack of
items, you will also get this window.
Inventory Screen
The Inventory screen is divided into five parts:
Inventory List - This is a list of all your inventory
items that your character is carrying. As you pick up new
items, they will be added to the top of the list. If you
Use an item from this list, it will automatically be used
on your character. If you Examine an item, the long
description will appear in the inventory screen Display
Window (see below.)
You can use the Home, End, PgUp, PgDn keys on your
keyboard to quickly move the inventory list from top to
bottom, and back.
The arrow buttons will also scroll the list. When an
arrow is white, the list can no longer be moved in that
direction. When the arrow is coloured yellow, you can
press it to move the list in that direction.

Character Portrait - This window
will change to show what armour
your character is wearing, and
weapon is equipped.
Display Window
- This window
normally shows
the current
status of your
character. At
the top of the
window is your
character’s
name. Below
that you find
some numbers and abbreviations.
ST, PE, EN, CH, IN, AG, LK - Your character’s current
statistics, which will include any modifiers for
radiation, chems or other effects.
Remember
that you must right-
click to change between
the hand and action
cursor.  It is only with
the action cursor that
you can drop, examine,
or use items.

Hit Points - Current HP/Maximum HP. When the first number
drops to 0, you are dead and the game is over.
Armour Class - This area shows the current Armour Class
(AC), Damage Resistance (DR) and Damage Threshold (DT)
for the armour you are currently wearing. The different
types of DR/DT are:
Normal - Bullets, knives and other blunt or sharp
objects.
Laser - Damage from laser weapons. Reflective armour
will have higher DR/DT in this type of damage.
Fire - Damage from flamers and other sources of heat.
Plasma - Damage from plasma weapons, which use super-
heated matter almost on the point of becoming pure
energy. Pretty advanced stuff.
Explode - Explosions of all types. Concussion and
blast damage.
AC is the negative modifier applied to people or critters
attacking you.
DT and DR are the amount of damage that the attack is
reduced by.
The two areas at the bottom of your display window are
for your currently active items (the items in ITEM1 and
ITEM2, respectively.) Basic information about the item or
weapon will be displayed, like the name. Other
information displayed depends on the object type. Weapons
will show damage, range, rounds left/maximum and the type
of ammo. Other items will have brief descriptions of
important information.
Current Weight/Total Weight - The two numbers at the
bottom of the screen show your current total weight for
all your inventory items, and the maximum amount of
weight that you can carry. You current weight cannot be
larger than your maximum weight.
Armour Slot - Only armour can be placed into this slot.
Use the hand cursor to drop armour items into this slot.

Any armour that is currently in the armour slot will be
dropped back into your inventory.
Item Slots - These two slots can hold items such as
weapons. Other items can be placed here and then used
from the Interface Bar. ITEM1 when empty can be used for
unarmed punch attacks. ITEM2 when empty can be used for
unarmed kick attacks.
There is also a DONE button. Press the DONE button to
return to the game. While you are in the Inventory
screen, time stops in the game. You can spend as much
real-world time as you want in this screen, and no time
will pass in the game.
Other Inventory Actions
You can also load and unload weapons. Drag ammo of the
appropriate type to the weapon. When you drag ammo to a
weapon, it will attempt to load it. To load the weapon
successfully, the ammo calibre must be the same as the
gun (no fair trying to load 9mm into a 10mm gun, either)
and ammo type (JHP, FMJ) must be the same. If the weapon
is completely loaded, you cannot add additional ammo,
either.
Unload ammo from weapons by using the Unload action
icon. The ammo will appear in your inventory. You can
also unload ammo from a loot screen. It is far easier to
carry small bits of ammo, then big heavy guns.
